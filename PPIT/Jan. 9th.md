>We have a **Job Event** on **February 27th**!


For job postings, we have experience with looking for job postings, such as :


1. LinkedIn  : lots of customization and alerts that are helpful 
2. Indeed : also customizable! 
3. Career Beacon 
4. Monster
   
   
   The issue with these sites are the requirement of having re-create the resume via a form, and then you would receive no responses. Some organizations are helpful and considerate and others are the opposite



#### Salaries 


We are here to make money in Cybersecurity. With experience, we would get six figure salaries. Not all jobs allow Remote Work, and some may require you to be in province. Remote Work has come a long way! Some individuals work remotely and relocate very often!

Salary negotiations is a huge deal. Sometimes, the salary could be a critical factor, as sometimes the negotiations stop there at times. 


#### Benefits 


Sometimes we are luckly with private insurance, where it comes dental for example. 

Relocation costs may sometimes be covered, and it is tax-claimable! Although, if you claim it, and then get laid off, you would be liable to pay taxes on it. 

Flextime is an important point for some organizations. Once you make the ranks of management, you would have the flexibility in organizing your time. 

Vacations are also important. Some organizations may have different arrangements, such as one organization giving the worker one extra day of vacation for every year of experience of working in the field. 


Bonuses are issued for sales departments usually. Sometimes, it is adopted by the IT departments as well. If there has been significant revenue for example, the other departments may get a percentage bonus. 

Parking could be a concern. Other benefits such as sick days, and flex days, are becoming more common. 


#### Professional Development 


Some organizations may talk the talk but not walk the walk. Others do practice what they preach. 



>[!Business Rule #1]
>
>From the perspective of  
your Professional IT  
career, communication  
is one of the most  
valuable subjects you  
will study in college.

Surprised?  

Source – Technical Communication, Paul V.  Anderson. In a survey that asked 225  
employers to identify the top  qualifications they seek in  
new employees, the highest number (98%) identified  
communication skills.  When 400 employers were  
asked in another survey to identify the most important  
outcomes of a college  education, they listed  
communicating effectively in writing and communicating  
effectively orally as two of the top three.  
The third?  Working effectively in teams,  
an ability that also depends  heavily on communication  
skills.  


#### Communication 

Russell mentioned a story of an employee that made a spelling error in the emails being sent to the clients. Communication provides connections between individuals, concepts and information. 

Tablets are often used in the past in the business world, but they would have the negative sideeffect of the employer not knowing if the employee is using the device for work-related purposes. 


One of the things we will work on is **Learning Circles**. Students will be placed in teams to discuss and research topics, and you would have to create a new group with a minimum of three members. If you have a team of 2 individuals, you would need a third individual. 


To prepare, student teams will research the theme using questions provided by the instructor. The group must keep track of sources and references used while preparing for the learning circle. A simple list on a WORD document with links and document names is acceptable. Assignments will be submitted to the droboxes provided by ONE member. ALL team member names must be on the submission. In-class time will be provided however teams are expected to co-ordinate accordingly to succeed.

There will be three scheduled learning circle meetings this semester.  

>[!Topics] 
>
#1. Diversity in the workplace and inclusivity  
#2. Preparing for industry – expectations  
#3. Ethics and decision making


## Learning Circle 1 


##### Diversity in the  workplace &  Inclusivity

It is all about being nice to each other, regardless of the different categories we place ourselves in as human beings, in terms of culture, identity, language and other categories. Women get paid less than men for the same programs. Unions provide a balancing factor. There are always challenges when we experience a disparity of social status and wealth between the different members of an organization.

###### Preview of Things to Come ....


###### Learning Circle 2 

**Elevator Pitches** are excellent opportunities that involve you selling yourself to a perspective employer. You would have to deal with limitations such as being shy. 

What is an elevator pitch? Write and practice your pitch with your group.  

What is a target list in  job searching?  

What are the  top three companies  you would place on a target list?  
Why?  Who would you approach for a letter of  recommendation as a new  
grad? Why?


###### Learning Circle 3 : Ethics and Decision Making 


There are ways to get around things. There are organizations that will create dummy references. Some companies check your references for you, such as in a situation where they would contact your references, and inquire whether they are likely to provide you with a positive reference. 

Throughout our career, we may be asked to do an unethical and sometimes illegal actions. An example was a company that specialized in manufacturing elements for commercials. The team was using illegally-obtained software to perform their CGI graphical duties. 

On YouTube, there was someone who mentioned that he had an illegal copy of Microsoft Windows, and the police did not act on it.

We will do **Mock Interviews**. HR individuals are busy, and they would obviously be an excellent resource on this skill. 

Telephone interviews are becoming a thing of the past slowly, as the new trend is a Microsoft Teams-based Interview. 


The final project is the **Portfolio**. We must work on it on our own time, in order for it to enable us to find the right career for us.
