# Class 2 


>[!today]
>
>We will discuss **Portfolios**, **Elevator-Pitches**  and more!



In our destinies, we have went through job interviews. It is important to be able to read the room! It is important to **Know Your Audience** !


>[!example]
>
>If you are talking about the things you have done in school, they may not understand everything! 


Using the same word when you talk about Network Traffic, we mention words such as **packets**, **frames**, **segments**, etc... Others may not understand the terminology, but they could understand the general gist if you can translate it to other non-technical words. 

If you are discussing firewalls, non-technical audiences may misunderstand it completely! 

If you use **slang** words, that could lead to misunderstanding. Even the pronounciation of the word "Router" will sound different in England vs Canada (router vs *rooter*).

You should make the best effort to include everyone into the conversation! 

If you start working in a new team, especially if you are part of a team that is in a different country, you may experience issues with communications. It could create a lot of problems for the audience or the speaker. 

You would deal with people from different walks of life. They may interpret things differently!

The work force is made up of **%34 Millennials**, **34% Generation X** and **29% Traditionalists.

How would you communicate with each of the Millennials, Generation X and Traditionalists? Each of them will have their own experiences that they grew up with.

>Traditionalists are born before 1946, they were raised with shortages, financial strife and traditional values.

>**Baby-Boomers** are born between 1946 - 1964, and they faced periods of positive societal change as well as low divorce rates, low job security and placed value on hard work. Influencing events were Woodstock, Watergate and women's rights. They had Televisions and Personal Computers

>**Millenials** are born between 1980 and 1995, they were raised with material posessions and disposable income. Influencing events were 9/11, corporate scandals and the financial collapse in 2008. Technology included social media, and there was a trend of significant attachment to personal technology.They feature short attention spans and lack of accountability. They are committed to learning with a hint of social value and relevance, and they place tremendous value on challenges and improvement.

>**Generation Z** are born between 1996 and 2010. A significant factor for them is the idea of **Instantaneous Connection**. They faced the *Great Recession* and the War on Terror.
