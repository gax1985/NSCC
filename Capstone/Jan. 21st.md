>

For the **proporsal** , we would need : 
 
 1. Tasks :

	Specific actions you are working on 

2. Milestones

	Specific goals 


In the proporsal, he would like us to have both milestones, and sub-tasks/tasks. Tasks can start mid-milestone that relate to another milestone. It is fine to have some overlap. 


Related to this , next week, we will start weekly scrum meetings, *a la pseudo-agile*. 

Wanted for scrum : 

1. Meet with our teams
2. At least one member of the team to take **minutes**, which is a notarized record for the meeting.

>On **Tuesday**, we need to meet with the team, and take minutes. Those are due on **Wednesdays**!
>
>> ... and on **Thursdays**, our instructor would talk about the collective information gathered from these meetings.
