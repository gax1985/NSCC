``Take on a project, and make your best attempt to complete it. It does not have to be successful, but the plan for the first week is to form groups and brainstorm projects``. 


Social Loafing :

The more people who work on something >> The average output per person is less. It is not necessarily a bad thing, so the maximum number per group is 4.

>For the groups, we can work as 2-4 individual teams. 


We are here to get hands-on experience on a group project applying as much as possible of the materials we have learned in class. 


There will be a presentation component. 


Active Participation in the project is mandatory.

#### Evaluations 


Starting on Week 3 or 4, we will have **Weekly Scrum Meeting**, where we will discuss our progress, and we would have a meeting minutes. We would have the **proposal** for the project, as well as two **milestone reports** about the project. They are worth 5%. The **Checkpoint Report** is in *March*, as well as a **Final Project** and **Presentation**. 

Ideally, it will not impact the grade if you realize you are encountering an unforeseen issue. It has been identified in the checkpoints. 




On Week 4 , the Scrum Meetings will start. You would have some idea about what your project will look like by then. By the end of this month, he would like us to be actively working on the project. 

## Brainstorming Activity 


The idea :


He provides us a blank piece of paper. Write down 1-3 ideas on this paper. The ideas do not have to be project ideas, as it could be general terms : 

1. Firewalls
2. IoT
3. Smart Home

The ideas should be related to the knowledge gained during our studies.
