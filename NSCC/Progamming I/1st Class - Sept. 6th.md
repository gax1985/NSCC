Programming is always *changing*, thus he will teach us how to learn!



Do **not** worry too much about syntax!


Much of what we do is :

		How do we solve a problem? 
		1. Identify the problem
		2. Figure out how to solve the problem.
		3. Figure out the simplest way to resolve it; we are telling the computer how to do something! 



We give *Instructions* ,



There are a few steps to accomplish something;

		To walk ...
				lift the foot, move the leg etc. ...


When we get a problem, we have to *understand* it, and divide the solution into *simple steps*



We will code with **Python** :D 

**Python** is used in an extensive array of applications, such as *IoT, Machine Learning , etc ...*


**Python** is logical, plain-English, *sans special characters*


**Python** is intuitive!


It is sometimes better to explain *pseudo-code* or *images*!


We will install **VSCode** , **GitHub** , **Python 3.11.5**

He mentioned a Python Project involving working with other people's code, understanding it, and figuring out how to solve a specific problem 


**Aka...The Grades Example**


It is not calculating the average, 

		You figure out how to calculate the average 

With GitHub, you can work with other people's code, fix any issues, add a commit (a comment about what you have done, explaining why you did the change "I updated the code because the connection to the database was not working", "average is not correct because the last grade was not added"), the team lead adds a comment ("This is not how you do this etc..."), 

#### Assignments

on **BrightSpace** :

[Homepage - Nova Scotia Community College](https://nscconline.brightspace.com/d2l/home)

Select the **Course** , then **Contents**, and then we will see our first assignment :

https://nscconline.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/280902/viewContent/4179814/View

**First Python App (Reposittory)


It will ask for a **GitHub** account. 


It takes you to **GitHub**, and prompts you to log in!


Afterwards, it will ask you to select your name!


You will see the *First-Python-App-gax1985*


The repo has two files. The one ending with *.py* this is the Python format


Click on the **Code** button and then **HTTPS**. This is the link we will use to clone the repo. 


Copy the link , and go to **VSCode**!


**View ---> Command Palette ---> enter "git" ---> click on "clone" ---> paste the link for the repo**


Then, it will ask you to select the location. Please select it!


Afterwards, you will need to log in into your GitHub account.


After it clones the repository, it will open it in VSCode!


For our assignment today, we have **2 files**!


we have a **README** file, which describes the project, 


and we have a **.py** file, which is a Python Project


If we wish to run the project, right-click on it, and select **"Run Python File in Terminal"**


In the terminal, if you wish to re-do the last command, hit the **UP Arrow** on the keyboard


This will re-do the command


(We can run the Python script with the **PLAY** button)


Now we change the name to our names, and save the file ( CTRL + S, or through the File menu)


Most of my colleagues were directed to the **Extensions** section 


We should install the **Python** extension!


If we click on **Source Control**, we can see the changes. (VSCode is saying that the files have been changed)

If we click on the file, it tells me what has changed in the code. The red line shows the former, and the green shows the latest moditification.


If we go to the text box above the commit button, we indicate why we have made the change. We should be as descriptive or as factual and concise as possible. Make it *meaningful*!


We have a fix for the prompt that appears on the Lab's computers :

		git config --global user.email "gax1985@gmail.com"

and 

		git config --global user.name "gax1985"

We saved a COMMIT message about the changes we have made


We would see we have changes to sync!

When we click **Commit** , we would sync our local code with our repo. 

If we were to go to https://www.github.com, and browse the repo, we would see the COMMIT message on the same line of the .py project.

If we tap on **History**, we would see the history of all the changes we have made. When we click on an individual event, we would see the exact changes!
#### How to Clone a Repo 






There will be repositories that we will clone, divide the steps, add commits explaining what we were thinking when we completed that step for **EVERY** step,
