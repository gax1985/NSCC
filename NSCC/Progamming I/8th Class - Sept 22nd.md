#### Sept 29th Due Date for the Assignment + Tech Check 2



We have to clone an empty repo, create a fodler structure, and then we will post our assignment there.  Upload Text file with the last commit "Ready for Marking " that I made 


We have 3 problems to develop : 

Weekly loan calculator

Imperial to Metric Converter 




Each problem has a **criteria for assessment**. Need **Input/Output**, **Variables**, **Comments** (other developers should be able to understand), **Proper Convention to Naming Variables** (stick with one, descriptive but not too-descriptive, **Commit Messages** (Development Process During the Project : 1-Clone the Repo, 2-Create a Folder , 3-Pseudocode , 4-Move the Template to the Repo, etc... It is a good idea to do multiple commits and in the commit message write what I have done). Every problem has a **commit message**. 

#### CICD (Continous Integration|Continous Development)

	Repo with multiple projects. You are a member of the 8team/. You commit, you push, and before yuou get to the problem that is running, there is a test that is happening so it would be totally integrated. 


We should be coming up with a plan for the problem. 
#### Debugging 


We create a blank VSCode file



Break point :  Add a break point by selecting the red dot . There is the point where we want the debugger to stop!

When we first launch the debugger, we have to configure it for the first time


It will stop at the brak point, if we click on "Step Over" it will jump over the break point. 


On the left (where the file explorer lives in VSCode), the debugger will show the variables on the left. It will ONLY show the variables that are before the break point. If we click on "Step Over", it will keep adding the variable declared on the next line. The variables it displays will be in bold (if integer) and a different color (when it is a string)


Format changes the output only but it does not change the variable 


If we know something is happening taht is right (unexpected output), the debugger helps us in discovering what went wrong. 


If we right-click on the line, there is an option to "Run this in debugber / evaluate this in debugger"


The debugger will help check line-by-line for the variable that is stored, and to identify the bug. 

Should add a comment # whenever we find a bug on the same line, and explain the bug. It is a good idea to CAPITALIZE the comment # BUG 🐛 
Another common one is 

> # TODO: work on the output


#### Broken Energy Calculator Exercise


Your Mission : 

	Detect any problems
	Add #BUG when discovering a bug, and explain the bug ; 
	value = "Enter your name"  #BUG We are missing input
	If something is correct, add #CHECK (It is a nice thing to do!)
When finished, save the file, and upload it in Brightspace 

Remember! Understand the problem first! Take a look at the Energy Cost Calculator on the link that was provided, it has explanations about the process, so use this information to determine whether the input/output are correct. 

##### Steps

1. Download the broken.py
2. Add it to a local folder
3. Add the comments with the   # BUG and # CHECK
4. Try to fix it!
5. Upload it to Brightspace

HINT : if the variable is greyed-out , it has never been utilized in the Python program
