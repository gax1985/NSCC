# Task 1



Google is arguably the most famous example of “Search Engines”, I mean who remembers Ask Jeeves? _shudders_

Now it might be rather patronising explaining how these “Search Engines” work, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes then what we see. More importantly, we can leverage this to our advantage to find all sorts of things that a wordlist wouldn’t. Researching as a whole - especially in the context of Cybersecurity encapsulates almost everything you do as a pentester. [MuirlandOracle](https://tryhackme.com/p/MuirlandOracle) has created a [fantastic room](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoresearch) on learning the attitudes towards how to research, and what information you can gain from it exactly.

"Search Engines" such as Google are huge indexers – specifically, indexers of content spread across the World Wide Web.

These essentials in surfing the internet use “Crawlers” or “Spiders” to search for this content across the World Wide Web, which I will discuss in the next task.




# Task 2 


What are Crawlers and how do They Work?

These crawlers discover content through various means. One being by pure discovery, where a URL is visited by the crawler and information regarding the content type of the website is returned to the search engine. In fact, there are lots of information modern crawlers scrape – but we will discuss how this is used later. Another method crawlers use to discover content is by following any and all URLs found from previously crawled websites. Much like a virus in the sense that it will want to traverse/spread to everything it can.  

  

Let's Visualise Some Things...

  

The diagram below is a high-level abstraction of how these web crawlers work. Once a web crawler discovers a domain such as **mywebsite.com**, it will index the entire contents of the domain, looking for keywords and other miscellaneous information - but I will discuss this miscellaneous information later.

  

![](https://i.imgur.com/4nrDDa0.png)

  

In the diagram above, "**mywebsite.com**" has been scraped as having the keywords as “Apple” “Banana" and “Pear”. These keywords are stored in a dictionary by the crawler, who then returns these to the search engine i.e. Google. Because of this persistence, Google now knows that the domain “**mywebsite.com**” has the keywords “Apple", “Banana” and “Pear”. As only one website has been crawled, if a user was to search for “Apple”...“**mywebsite.com**” would appear. This would result in the same behaviour if the user was to search for “Banana”. As the indexed contents from the crawler report the domain as having “Banana”, it will be displayed to the user.

  
As illustrated below, a user submits a query to the search engine of “Pears". Because the search engine only has the contents of one website that has been crawled with the keyword of “Pears” it will be the only domain that is presented to the user.   

![](https://i.imgur.com/nbbsAp4.png)

However, as we previously mentioned, **crawlers attempt to traverse, termed as crawling, every URL and file that they can find!** Say if “**mywebsite.com**” had the same keywords as before (“Apple", “Banana” and “Pear”), but also had a URL to another website “**anotherwebsite.com**”, the crawler will then attempt to traverse everything on that URL (**anotherwebsite.com**) and retrieve the contents of everything within that domain respectively.  

  
This is illustrated in the diagram below. The crawler initially finds “**mywebsite.com**”, where it crawls the contents of the website - finding the same keywords (“Apple", “Banana” and “Pear”) as before, but it has additionally found an external URL. Once the crawler is complete on “**mywebsite.com**”, it'll proceed to crawl the contents of the website “**anotherwebsite.com**”, where the keywords ("Tomatoes", “Strawberries” and “Pineapples”) are found on it. The crawler's dictionary now contains the contents of both “**mywebsite.com**” and “**anotherwebsite.com**”, which is then stored and saved within the search engine.

  

![](https://i.imgur.com/CIM2c6N.png)

  

Recapping

So to recap, the search engine now has knowledge of two domains that have been crawled:  
1. mywebsite.com  
2. anotherwebsite.com

Although note that “**anotherwebsite.com**” was only crawled because it was referenced by the first domain “**mywebsite.com**”. Because of this reference, the search engine knows the following about the two domains:  

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Domain Name**|**Keyword**|
|mywebsite.com|Apples|
|mywebsite.com|Bananas|
|mywebsite.com|Pears|
|anotherwebsite.com|Tomatoes|
|anotherwebsite.com|Strawberries|
|anotherwebsite.com|Pineapples|

Or as illustrated below:

![](https://i.imgur.com/BJeI451.png)  

  

Now that the search engine has some knowledge about keywords, say if a user was to search for “Pears” the domain “**mywebsite.com**” will be displayed - as it is the only crawled domain containing "Pears":  

![](https://i.imgur.com/lBD6FPD.png)  

Likewise, say in this case the user now searches for "Strawberries". The domain "**anotherwebsite.com**" will be displayed, as it is the only domain that has been crawled by the search engine that contains the keyword "Strawberries":

![](https://i.imgur.com/1LGoslC.png)  

  

This is great...But imagine if a website had multiple external URL's (as they often do!) That'll require a lot of crawling to take place. There's always the chance that another website might have similar information as of that another website crawled - right? So how does the "Search Engine" decide on the hierarchy of the domains that are displayed to the user?

In the diagram below in this instance, if the user was to search for a keyword such as "Tomatoes" (which websites 1-3 contain) who decides what website gets displayed in what order?

![](https://i.imgur.com/OG2Fgsx.png)

  

A logical presumption would be that website 1 -> 3 would be displayed...But that's not how real-world domains work and/or are named.

So, who (or what) decides the hierarchy? Well...



# Task 3


## Search Engine Optimisation

Search Engine Optimisation or SEO is a prevalent and lucrative topic in modern-day search engines. In fact, so much so, that entire businesses capitalise on improving a domains SEO “ranking”. At an abstract view, search engines will “prioritise” those domains that are easier to index. There are many factors in how “optimal” a domain is - resulting in something similar to a point-scoring system.

  

To highlight a few influences on how these points are scored, factors such as:  

• How responsive your website is to the different browser types I.e. Google Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer - this includes Mobile phones!

• How easy it is to crawl your website (or if crawling is even allowed ...but we'll come to this later) through the use of "Sitemaps"

>[!info]
>
>What is a **Sitemap** ?
>
>>[!answer]
>>
>>A sitemap is a file that provides information about the pages, videos, and other files on your website, and the relationships between them. Search engines like Google use this file to crawl your site more efficiently. 
>>
>>There are different types of sitemaps:
>>
>>1. XML Sitemaps: These are primarily for search engines and help them understand the structure of your site.
>>2. HTML Sitemaps: These are designed for users to help them navigate your site.
>>3. News Sitemaps: These help search engines find and understand news content on your site.
>>4. Image and Video Sitemaps: These provide information about the images and videos on your site.
>>
>>Sitemaps are particularly useful for large or complex websites, new sites with few external links, or sites with rich media content1. They help ensure that search engines can find and index all the important pages on your site.

• What kind of keywords your website has (i.e. In our examples if the user was to search for a query like “Colours” no domain will be returned - as the search engine has not (yet) crawled a domain that has any keywords to do with “Colours”

  

There is a lot of complexity in how the various search engines individually "point-score" or rank these domains - including vast algorithms. Naturally, the companies running these search engines such as Google don't share exactly how the hierarchic view of domains ultimately ends up. Although, as these are businesses at the end of the day, you can pay to advertise/boost the order of which your domain is displayed.

  

There are various online tools - sometimes provided by the search engine providers themselves that will show you just how optimised your domain is. For example, let's use [Google's Site Analyser](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to check the rating of [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/):  

![](https://i.imgur.com/kvaFolh.png)  

  

![](https://i.imgur.com/6rFnpVc.png)  

According to this tool, TryHackMe has an SEO rating of **85/100** (as of 14/11/2020). That's not too bad and it'll show the justifications as to how this score was calculated below on the page.

  

But...Who or What Regulates these "Crawlers"?

Aside from the search engines who provide these "Crawlers", website/web-server owners themselves ultimately stipulate what content "Crawlers" can scrape. Search engines will want to retrieve **everything** from a website - but there are a few cases where we wouldn't want **all** of the contents of our website to be indexed! Can you think of any...? How about a secret administrator login page? We don't want **everyone** to be able to find that directory - especially through a google search.

Introducing Robots.txt...



# Task 4


## Robots.txt

Similar to "Sitemaps" which we will later discuss, this file is the first thing indexed by "Crawlers" when visiting a website.

  

But what is the **Robots.txt** file?

This file must be served at the ``root directory`` - specified by the webserver itself. Looking at this files extension of **.txt**, its fairly safe to assume that it is a text file.

The text file defines the permissions the "Crawler" has to the website. For example, what type of "Crawler" is allowed (I.e. You only want Google's "Crawler" to index your site and not MSN's). Moreover, Robots.txt can specify what files and directories that we do or don't want to be indexed by the "Crawler".

A very basic markup of a Robots.txt is like the following:

![](https://i.imgur.com/wZ3lo4B.png)  

  

Here we have a few keywords...

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Keyword|Function|
|User-agent|Specify the type of "Crawler" that can index your site (the asterisk being a wildcard, allowing **all "User-agents"**|
|Allow|Specify the directories or file(s) that the "Crawler" **can** index|
|Disallow|Specify the directories or file(s) that the "Crawler" **cannot** index|
|Sitemap|Provide a reference to where the sitemap is located (improves SEO as previously discussed, we'll come to sitemaps in the next task)|

  

In this case:

1. Any "Crawler" can index the site

2. The "Crawler" is allowed to index the entire contents of the site

3. The "Sitemap" is located at [http://mywebsite.com/sitemap.xml](http://mywebsite.com/sitemap.xml)[](http://mywebsite.com/sitemap.xml)

  

Say we wanted to hide directories or files from a "Crawler"? Robots.txt works on a "blacklisting" basis. Essentially, **unless told otherwise**, the Crawler will index whatever it can find.

![](https://i.imgur.com/audlFn8.png)

In this case:

1. Any "Crawler" can index the site  

2. The "Crawler" can index every other content that isn't contained within "/super-secret-directory/".

Crawlers also know the differences between sub-directories, directories and files. Such as in the case of the second "Disallow:" ("/not-a-secret/but-this-is/")

The "Crawler" will index all the contents within "**/not-a-secret/**", but will not index anything contained within the sub-directory **"/but-this-is/"**.

3. The "Sitemap" is located at [http://mywebsite.com/sitemap.xml](http://mywebsite.com/sitemap.xml)[](http://mywebsite.com/sitemap.xml)

  

What if we Only Wanted Certain "Crawlers" to Index our Site?

We can stipulate so, such as in the picture below:

![](https://i.imgur.com/LxitBJs.png)

In this case:

1. The "Crawler" "Googlebot" is allowed to index the entire site ("Allow: /")

2. The "Crawler" "msnbot" is not allowed to index the site (Disallow: /")

  

How about Preventing Files From Being Indexed? 

Whilst you can make manual entries for every file extension that you don't want to be indexed, you will have to provide the directory it is within, as well as the full filename. Imagine if you had a huge site! What a pain...Here's where we can use a bit of [regexing](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html).

![](https://i.imgur.com/mzDqFVY.png)

In this case:

1. Any "Crawler" can index the site

2. However, the "Crawler" cannot index **any** file that has the extension of **.ini** within any directory/sub-directory using ("$") of the site.

3. The "Sitemap" is located at [http://mywebsite.com/sitemap.xml](http://mywebsite.com/sitemap.xml)


>[!info]
>
>Here is a clearer explanation of this example ( in contrast to the lack of clarify) : 
>
>1. **User-agent: **_: This line specifies that the rule applies to all web crawlers. The asterisk "*" is a wildcard that matches any user agent.
>
>2. **Disallow: /*.ini$**: This line uses a regular expression to disallow access to any URL that ends with `.ini`. Here’s the breakdown:
>
  >  - `/*`: The forward slash (/) indicates the root directory, and the asterisk (*) is a wildcard that matches any sequence of characters.
  >  - `.ini`: This specifies that the URL should end with `.ini`.
    >- `$`: The dollar sign indicates the end of the URL.
    >
    >So, `/*.ini$` means any URL ending with `.ini` will be disallowed for all user agents.
>
>3. **Sitemap: http://mywebsite.com/sitemap.xml**: This line provides the location of the sitemap for the website. Sitemaps help search engines find and index the pages on your site more efficiently.





Why would you want to hide a **.ini** file for example? Well, files like this contain sensitive configuration details. Can you think of any other file formats that might contain sensitive information?



# Sitemaps

Comparable to geographical maps in real life, “Sitemaps” are just that - but for websites!

  
“Sitemaps” are indicative resources that are helpful for crawlers, as they specify the necessary routes to find content on the domain. The below illustration is a good example of the structure of a website, and how it may look on a "Sitemap":

![](https://i.imgur.com/L5WqJU4.png)

  

The blue rectangles represent the **route** to nested-content, similar to a directory I.e. “Products” for a store. Whereas, the green rounded-rectangles represent an actual page. However, this is for illustration purposes only - “Sitemaps” don't look like this in the real world. They look something much more similar to this:  

  

![](https://i.imgur.com/12Yxcn5.png)

“Sitemaps” are XML formatted. I won't explain the structure of this file-formatting as the room [XXE](https://tryhackme.com/jr/xxe) created by [falconfeast](https://tryhackme.com/p/falconfeast) does a mighty fine job of this.


>[!info]
>
>### Structure of an XML Sitemap
>
An XML sitemap is essentially a list of URLs for a site, along with additional metadata about each URL. This metadata helps search engines understand when a page was last updated, how often it changes, and how important it is relative to other URLs on the site. Here’s a basic example of an XML sitemap:
>
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>http://www.example.com/</loc>
    <lastmod>2024-09-08</lastmod>
    <changefreq>daily</changefreq>
    <priority>1.0</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>http://www.example.com/about</loc>
    <lastmod>2024-09-07</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.8</priority>
  </url>
  <!-- Additional URLs -->
</urlset>
```
>
>### Key Elements
>
>1. **`<urlset>`**: This is the root element that encloses all the URLs in the sitemap. It includes the namespace attribute `xmlns` which specifies the XML schema.
  >  
>2. **`<url>`**: Each URL entry is enclosed within a `<url>` tag. This tag contains all the metadata for a single URL.
  >  
>3. **`<loc>`**: This tag specifies the URL of the page. It is a required tag.
  >  
>4. **`<lastmod>`**: This optional tag indicates the last modification date of the page. It helps search engines determine how frequently the content changes.
>
>5. **`<changefreq>`**: This optional tag provides a hint to search engines about how frequently the page is likely to change. Common values include `always`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`, and `never`.
>
>6. **`<priority>`**: This optional tag indicates the priority of the URL relative to other URLs on your site. The value ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being the highest priority.
>
>### Importance for Web Crawlers
>
>Web crawlers use XML sitemaps to discover and index the pages on your site more efficiently. [By providing a clear structure and metadata, you help search engines understand the importance and update frequency of your pages, which can improve your site’s visibility in search results](https://www.webnots.com/beginners-guide-to-sitemap/)[1](https://www.webnots.com/beginners-guide-to-sitemap/)[2](https://slickplan.com/blog/sitemap-structure).

>
>The presence of "Sitemaps" holds a fair amount of weight in influencing the "optimisation" and favorability of a website. As we discussed in the "Search Engine Optimisation" task, these maps make the traversal of content much easier for the crawler!

Why are "Sitemaps" so Favourable for Search Engines?

Search engines are lazy! Well, better yet - search engines have a lot of data to process. The efficiency of how this data is collected is paramount. Resources like "Sitemaps" are extremely helpful for "Crawlers" as the necessary routes to content are already provided! All the crawler has to do is scrape this content - rather than going through the process of manually finding and scraping. Think of it as using a wordlist to find files instead of randomly guessing their names!

  

The easier a website is to "Crawl", the more optimised it is for the "Search Engine"



# Google Dorking



## Using Google for Advanced Searching

  

As we have previously discussed, Google has a lot of websites crawled and indexed. Your average Joe uses Google to look up Cat pictures (I'm more of a Dog person myself...). Whilst Google will have many Cat pictures indexed ready to serve to Joe, this is a rather trivial use of the search engine in comparison to what it can be used for.  
For example, we can add operators such as that from programming languages to either increase or decrease our search results - or perform actions such as arithmetic!

![](https://i.imgur.com/hrfWM6i.png)  
  
Say if we wanted to narrow down our search query, we can use quotation marks. Google will interpret everything in between these quotation marks as exact and only return the results of the exact phrase provided...Rather useful to filter through the rubbish that we don't need as we have done so below:

![](https://i.imgur.com/pJSW4ou.png)  

  

Refining our Queries

  

We can use terms such as “**site**” (such as bbc.co.uk) and a query (such as "gchq news") to search the specified site for the keyword we have provided to filter out content that may be harder to find otherwise. For example, using the “site” and "query" of "bbc" and "gchq", we have modified the order of which Google returns the results.  
  
In the screenshot below, searching for “gchq news” returns approximately 1,060,000 results from Google. The website that we want is ranked behind GCHQ's actual website:

![](https://i.imgur.com/b4duG6S.png)  
  
But we don't want that...We wanted “**bbc****.co.****uk**” first, so let's refine our search using the “**site**” term. Notice how in the screenshot below, Google returns with much fewer results? Additionally, the page that we didn't want has disappeared, leaving the site that we did actually want! 

![](https://i.imgur.com/dG3e64O.png)  
  
Of course, in this case, GCHQ is quite a topic of discussion - so there'll be a load of results regardless.

  

So What Makes "Google Dorking" so Appealing?

  

First of all - and the important part - it's legal! It's all indexed, publicly available information. However, what you do with this is where the question of legality comes in to play...

  

A few common terms we can search and combine include:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Term|Action|
|filetype:|Search for a file by its extension (e.g. PDF)|
|cache:|View Google's Cached version of a specified URL|
|intitle:|The specified phrase MUST appear in the title of the page|

For example, let's say we wanted to use Google to search for all PDFs on bbc.co.uk:

  

`site:bbc.co.uk filetype:pdf`

  

![](https://i.imgur.com/xoDtXnA.png)

Great, now we've refined our search for Google to query for all publically accessible PDFs on "**bbc.co.uk**" - You wouldn't have found files like this "Freedom of Information Request Act" file from a wordlist!

  

Here we used the extension **PDF**, but can you think of any other file formats of sensitive nature that **may** be publically accessible? (Often unintentionally!!) Again, what you do with any results that you find is where the legality comes into play - this is why "Google Dorking" is so great/dangerous.

  

Here is simple directory traversal.

  

**I have blanked out a lot of the below to cover you, me, THM and the owners of the domains:**
