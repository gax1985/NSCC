<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>Final Presentation</strong></p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The objective of the final presentation is to get you to explore, in more detail, a topic covered during the class. It is to give you an opportunity to research and better understand something in cybersecurity that piqued your interest.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">If you thought the juice shop challenge was fun, perhaps you want to research another challenge platform which we did not utilize in the class. You read about it, set it up, do some of the challenges and present that to the class. Let us know if there were any <em>gotchas </em>to getting it up and running.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Perhaps you were amazed (or amused) to hear about all the default passwords in the wild. Perhaps you would want to investigate default password policies of major manufacturers of computing infrastructure equipment. You could tell us what default passwords are currently in use. Is there a definitive list of that. Could you get an estimate of how many of those devices are online somehow? What else could you dive into and learn about and then share with the class?</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">If you are stuck for a topic - or just prefer more guidance - then pick:</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">1) Pick one of the OWASP Top 10 issues.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">2) Research the top 5 exploits for that issue.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">3) Research the top mitigation strategies for each exploit.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">4) Find a reported example of that exploit in the wild.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">5) Present your findings in a PowerPoint presentation.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The talk should be a maximum of 10 minutes long. The timer starts when you are called to present and ends when you start to walk back to your seat. So, plan on 5-8 minutes real talking time. The rubric is attached to the Final Presentation assignment folder. The instructor will take notes and you will be graded during your presentation.&nbsp;However, your grade may not be available immediately.</p>
