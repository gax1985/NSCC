Ron Macleod is our *adviser*

Melanie is a *student services adviser*


The difference between a faculty advisor ad a student services adviser is about the scope. Ron would be the adviser to talk to if we encounter academic issues. Anything involving the Work Term, then Ron would be the one to contact about it. If I have any psychological barriers for example, I would speak to Melanie. 

If considering dropping a course, or if you are encountering issues with full-time studies with a full-time job, then speak to Ron about the intensity of the program. If encountering challenges that are not academic, speak to Melanie. 

Ron would like us to not just do presentations, as we will be advising CEOs for example. Peer-training executives implies considering the audience.
