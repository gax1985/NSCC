#### Pretend you are a contractor!

1. Consider the time value in terms of money. "Principes of Success in this program" ; "Act like you are already a contractor". Optimize the work load schedule. Are we doing the highest value things? 
2. We need to **triage** the work. Emphasize the things that take higher priority.  Whne the program was designed, the intention was for us to *grow*
3. Professional Practices for IT : it is the course with the lowest work load, but it is the most important for the desired result of *excelling in our careers*. The biggest disappointment for Marc was hearing from a student that they do not remember a thing from the course. The better result is I remember *one* thing that made the most impact on my life!



## IT Job Fair : Feb. 21st 2024 


###### The #1 Opportunity for our careers!


Marc has a Sharepoint site containing 10 years full of files. It is incrementally being improved! 



## 15-Minute Tai-Chi Session : 

	Monday  12:00-12:15PM
	Tuesday   3:45-4:00PM
	Wednesday 3:45-4:00PM



Work on the final project for 15 minutes per day! 


Someone had issues with *measuring* progress. 


## Assignment 2 : Asking the Right Questions 


He liked how many of us answered, but he found some of us sugar-coated the answers. He is trying to get us to think about different roles. If we are not in that role, it becomes fictitious. If we are walking away from this exercise knowing that there will be many different circumstances and roles that we will be forced to play out. 


#### Background Context : 

Peoplesoft looked like it was from the 1990s; Peoplesoft are not necessarily evil. We have to use the tools we were handed. 
There were 101 departments and agencies 
Started on December 2009. A modern system was needed. 
Awarded in June 2011 to IBM/Peoplesoft
March 2014, IBM was no longer training anyone. 
Changing the pay system to relocate to Miramishi

As an IT specialist, will we be in a communications role ? 


#### Customer service approach : 

1. Acknowledge
2. Give a realistic answer (consider the 2015 context)
3. Less is more, but be concise! 
4. "Thank you for contacting me ... We are aware of this issue. I assure you our team are working on resolving this issue as soon as we can. Here is the timeline ..."
5. "We know you are overwhelmed! Here is a way to reach us ! " --> We acknowledge the problem, giving people an outlet 
6. Technical training overall : 
	1. High-level planning to cover the basics : Break things into chunks --> Teach it --> Confirm it!
	2. Bring enough experts to train others, and to take the load off.
	3. We need Peoplesoft experts! Marc used to work for Metro Transit. The routes were in a spreadsheet. Someone make a Lotus database for the routes, and that someone left Transit, and noone had any idea how to accomplish what he did with Lotus. 
	4. Create an overview of all the information to be taught
	5. Break them down into chunks :
		1. Basics of the pay system
		2. How to navigate the system
		3. Key Peoplesoft and Payroll **Concepts**
		4. Practice how the Geologist payrolls integrate with Peoplesoft. They worked on speadsheets to track requests from different departments in the city. They used to work with pen and paper at the time, so they had to figure out Peoplesoft quickly!
		5. Marc : Concepts , Procedures, Principles 
		6. Practice in a live environment with direct expert support
		7. Educate on the Geologist Pay rolls
7. Project manager : 
	1. Project Management
		1. Scope : "Take some paint and paint **two walls** of this room"
		2. Quality: Someone applying primer before painting, multiple layers of paint and making sure not to paint the outline. "We implemented **Change Management**" . **Business elicitation**. 
		
		3. Time   :  "We have a backlog of 40000 cases. We are reporting stats ( a certain number) of 80000 pay rules. We are looking at a timeline of ..."" 
		4. Budget

#### Strategy :


1. No **Sugar-Coating!** Be **objective** *not* political!
2. Be **specific** at a high-level 


#### Talking Points : 

1. Peoplesoft is not ready for the rollout, and indicate the number of business processes that have been mapped.
2. As of 2016, we have 40000 backlog. Provide an estimate in terms of the backlog cases involving the amount needed to be paid to the workers. Provide an estimated percentage (20%)
3. Here is a revised *realistic* **schedule** and **budget**.
--------------------------------------------------

## Task B - Saying the Right Things








-------------------------------------

## Project Blackbird 


- We need to ask better questions! Make sure you have the best possible understanding on what it means
- Marc thought that he perceived from students a bit too late on the necessity to ask the right questions, and the necessity to actually **ASK** questions!

## The Next Challenge : Assignment 2 : Asking Good Questions


We are being hired for our technological skills of analysis. We have 6 examples of analysis.


We have **Process**

Experimentation allows us to discover the *limits* to our knowledge. It shows us what we know, do not know, and what areas that we should learn. So, we decide what we will learn, and create experiments involving the topic. So, as a example, if we are doing a dropshipping business venture online, and we wish to know the best shipping option there is for products made in China to arrive within an expected time (compared to ordering from North America) we create a scenario where each person chooses one shipping option, and then we gauge any points that would lead to a slow down. So, in this case, the blind spots could be : How much time would a package get stuck in customs, whether the next shipping company that takes over from the first shipping company will do their part in getting it to the next shipping agent on time. It would be good to provide a realistic expectation for the shipping date. 

## Understand it - Simplify it - Explain it !


#### Less is More!

User stories : 

	Asking someone what they want, what they need, and organize in a way to accomplish it. Who What and Why? Who are we discussing (who will use it) , what they want to do, and why they want to do that. We consider how to put it in a diagram. We start horozontially, such as using a credit card online : select the card type, enter the card's information, CVV etc... (You think you know what you are doing. The client may have some unexpected want and need) 



Brainstorming : 


	Getting information from people. Get people into a room to attain an idea, and then to analyse it later. Bring people in a room, and ask each person to come up with an idea on a sticky note, and all without talking to each other. Each idea would have its own weight. The group then groups them in different idea types, get rid of duplicates, and pick out a topic that is unique, which would be utilized to come up with better ideas.  


Decision Tables :


	Good way to come up with decision logic. To build a table, we find the results, we pick the conditions (simple yes/no answers) , ideal table contains 2X4 sections. 


Illicitations/Analysis/Requirements


	Listening to your clients, friends or anyone taking in the information, and understanding what they want. TYou come back with an analysis of what you comprehended from them. We do it subconciously. 


	Response from Marc : Ask questions, so you can listen, so you can ask more questions, so you can listen some more, and then you attain deeper understanding ...


Levels of detail

	Consider all the different things to be done, like the layers of an onion. The outside of the onion would be the big picture and what kind of problems we are dealing with, then we get to the user and what they want, what is the data, what is the process, and what steps need to be taken to accomplish it. 

	Response from Marc : You finish this process when ALL the stakeholders are content with it. Eveyone has to mutually agree, and this is rare. 



Observation 


	aka. Job Shadowing. When you are observing people using your product , what you want is what they feel when they use it, what their minds think of it, any external tools . Passive vs Active : Passive can be without their knowledge. Active : Interactions with the individual can change the way the user is using the product. 



Workshops 


	aka a group plan to draw out the information before facing the stakeholders and customers. Involves collaboration and to be on the same page when it comes to the material. Body language helps with the delivery of the message. 


	Response from Marc : Well-planned fun party, where everyone should be on the same page. 



Context Diagram 



	Broad way to visualize the project you are doing. It is for stake holders and non-technical peolple. It is not too detailed. Thhe video's example is the payment processor. If it was too technical, people would not necessarily undertand it. 

	Marc's response : Cool people who are thinking who is using our product? 


State/Sequence Diagrams 


	State the item is at a given time . Sequence : state the steps the person goes through to get from A to B in the program or product. 



Process Models 


	Creating a visual to organize information , and used for analysis. It should be easy to follow and simple! 


	Marc : Everythhing tends to get overly complicated. In job fairs, it is nightmarish to run. They resolved these issues with process models. 





#### We are getting the Right Vocabulary! 


We need to be **familiar** with these terms, so we can *learn them* , and *demostrate our knowledge*. 


Marc : An usual issue is **Not asking the right questions!**. Show someone else my work, and ask questions .
