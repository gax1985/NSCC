## Saying the Right Things to the Right People



#### We should start our projects :D


Life is short ...

We do not want to be going down a path that is not right for us, and not do anything about it ...


We want something that is right for us ...



He looks at the course outline, and considers what he has done that day. We can look at **Brightspace**, and we see session 3 with *Task B*. 


**Project Template** is a good idea!


Let us look at Brightspace : 


DevTyper (Website for improving typing speed )



He would like us to do the following : 

1. Decide on the major project's topic
2. Come up with a 6 week schedule and fill out the Project Template.
3. We need to come up with methods of proving that we are following our schedule
4. Come up with a summary for all the activities that were done
5. Book an appointment with him 


Tai-Chi starts in October . Now it is a soft start


Assignment 2 - Train the class 
Assignment 3 - Presentation to Executives
Assignment 4 - Training session for people 



When he thinks of communications, they have **four** broad aspects : 


His assignments are version 1 , version 2 , version 3 , version 4 , etc ...

Is my thought clear enough? I have to think of the audience; every different audience have a different perspective. 

Whatever you do, you would think it won't be good the first time you do it. When you do it though, you are beta-testing the idea!

What is the context for the words? 
Listening is another important part of it. We need feedback to get better knowledge about people and context.

When communicating, we should personalize, never-negativize, positivize , empathize, listen , never-interrupt, 

We have to start providing analogies to all the technical things we are learning,
we have two types of analogies, one is to identify identical relationships , on-off
and the second to identify shared abstractions, such as comparing gardening with raising children 




#### Project Blackbird ---> Look it up!


## Analogies 


1. Try to come up with an analogy that most people can relate to, or even better, everyone can relate to!



## Technical Training 


1. Consider the context of the training 
2. Consider the audience, and their needs
3. Consider whether the information we will train others on are either ; fact/concept, procedures, process or principle? 
4. Break the information into small chunks
5. Think about the best way to explain it, such as analogies etc (intro bits)
6. TEACH IT! ---> Train them how to do something
7. PRACTICE it ! ---> Get them to practice what they have learned
8. CONFIRM IT -----> 


COntent types : 

1. Facts and concepts:
	1. How to teach : provide definition and practice with mnemonicas and games
	2. Classroom practice : try different examples, and see which works best
2. Procedures: 
	1. Teaching something specific




We aim for results ! he needs to hear : 
1. scope : the defined area of the work
3. budget : How much money do we have?
4. time : How much time do we have ? he needs a timeline
5. quality : Project manager wants to know : are we working in the scope? Results! 

Status update : 


1. Status update
2. Propose an idea

4. Why are we doing the changes
5. We need to be accurate and objective
6. Sell them the benefits without overinflating. Do it with the right facts.
7. Watch 'Communicating with Executives' on LinkedIn Learning
8. When talking to executives, we are either : pitching an idea, providing an initiative update (give them the best information possible), worry about your credibility of being able to get the job done. 
9. You can not start off with the solution : make them understand the problem, after yourself understanding the CEO's perspective. Make sure this person understands enough details just so they know you are doing a good job
10. Flow : 40000 FT explain the problem | 1000 feet | solution at 50000 then bring them down to 1000 ft with the solution



Task B ---- > work on it



#### Pheonix Pay System Disaster on Youtube


Business Needs and Business Requirements : not enough resources are in place for business requirements/needs.

Conservative government refused to use IBM's recommended training program.


It is rarely about the Technology section

Which perspective are we assuming? we are IT professionals, and we are giving objective IT analysis.
