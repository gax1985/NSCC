Tai Chi happening today after class


IT Job Fair.ca



He uses Sharepoint, as today is all about referencing. 

He is looking to have new members on his team. His philosophy is redundancy. We would help each other out.


He discovered that 20 organizations committed to come to the Job Fair. 

He is looking for cool 1st years to be on his team. He wants the workload is managed, and to have good control for time management. There are different roles and different ways to improve the portfolio. 


The greatest strength on that Job Fair is confidence. There is a whole different mindset between being an organizer vs being just an attendee. 


If it fits with the workload, it is worth it. 




## Business Writing and Documentation 




We will work on **Check-Ins**, and **Task-C**. 


He will check with us on our projects. 

#### Task C 

Choose your own adventure 



We mentioned Saying the Right Things to the Right People, and now we will learn how to Talk to Executives. 



#### What do executives talk about ? 


1. Recommendations
2. How big is your idea (cost)? 
4. How is it going (the idea-try to make an observation for this week within the context of this idea)?

## Documentation 



#### Risk


Theme today is about **Personal Productivity Tools in a Business Environment**.


We will discuss *business writing* too!


As IT professionals, it is not good enough to take our personal experiences with writing on Google Docs, and claim to know it. 


As an IT professional, you are expected to know **Office 365**.


It is important to know them. You can not use the same tools all the time, so our journeys would involve *continuous learning*


33% of general office workers lack *computer and office skills*. We are not learning to become office workers, but we have to have the right perspective. We will be in the IT part of that organization. 


We usually would get techy questions from our family members. 


34% of **Office** subscriptions are *underutilized*


###### What do you think the following applications do ? 

Vizio - Flow Chart
Forms - Creating forms ( it facilitates Data Analysis)
OneNote - Note-taking application ( a combination of Word, Excel, and Powerpoint) 
Word - Places text on a sheet
Excel - Spreadsheet
PowerPoint - Slides 
SharePoint - A Documentation repository
Planner - Project Management-Light (Kanban Board)
Project - Like Planner (but not included in our subscriptions)


It is in our best interest to know them through-and-through. 


Watch YouTube videos on "How to get the best out of **Office365** ?"


He reinforced *Sharepoint* because all the previous participants would come and go, and their knowledge went away with them. Thus, this is a good area to store all their knowledge in one area. 


The benefits of using Office-Productivity tools are : 


1. Seamless integration : Inforcing Office365 means **collaboration** online
2. Single-Sign-On : Users can have one account to log into it
3. Availability: Information is always available on the cloud!
4. IT Support : support from Microsoft
5. Organization : everything is organized 
6. Collaboration with others!

## Risk 



When it comes to filling out forms and documentations, how do you think most companies view documentation? 


###### Priority Table 


1 Important    |    2|not Important
urgent   |  Not urgent 
------------------------------------------------
3 Not               |     4|Not Important 
  Important             Not Urgent     
  URGENT



76% of companies lose a lot because of poor documentation skills. 


This is a workterm opportunity. If they know it is important, and they do not want to do it, then if someone comes along and offers their services, they are most likely to accept! This is a great opportunity.


Companies focus on writers and those with exceptional documentation skills. 


We can offer to *document certain things*. 


Imagine walking up to someone, and saying "Can you hire me for my work term?" 

Do NOT say that, but say "I am interested in doing Documentation, and I am a cybersecurity student". This is specific, and chances are , since 76% of companies need documentation, then this opens a huge door for us!

The company will be grateful we are doing it, and they are now TALKING to us. 




## Business Writing 



Most of us write in a certain way. 


Imagine you are as far away from the demonstrated drawing as we are, and we are looking at a page with scribbled words. This is **NOT** business writing.


#### Business writing involves : 


1. Short sentences
2. Direct language
3. Bullets
4. Short paragraphs
5. Sub-titles (easy to skim through)


We need an **Eagle-Eye Perspective**, so it needs to be clearly defined as a document. 


#### Business Writing vs Academic Writing 


Academic Writing : 

	The longer the paper, the better ...
	Synonyms
	


Business Writing : 

	Clear and to the point. 
	Simple words 
	Short words. 


He spoke about work, business writing, Office365.
