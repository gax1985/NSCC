This is the course intended to prepare us for our career. 


We are growing new eyes; *a la Pill Rogue*...



The events we will learn about are from his life


The world today is full of misinformation. This misinformation is targeted, and designed by Human Behaviour scientists to change what you believe. 


This course is walking us through the evolution of cyber crime!


### Cyber Security in IT : Postcards from the Front



He computerized businesses around the provice in 1982. 
He has an undergraduate and graduate degrees in Computer Sceince with specializations in Artificial Intelligence and Network Security
He created and patented surveillance software well ahead of its time
He is president of High Tech Crime Investigation Association. The other side is not allowed to join. Mexico is not allowed to join, because it is easy to become a police officer, and the corruption that it brings in Mexico. It has organizations all around the world.

The industry leaders in this province are all old friends. 
He taught at Dalhousie and Saint Mary's University.
He got his best employees from NSCC
He volunteered with students in the IT program.



### The Other Side


We are actively at war!

The other size : 

	Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran
		(There are others, but these four are the most effective.)
A real cyberattack puts us in the middle ages
A kinetic attack destroys us all


When Iran started making nuclear weapons, their assets were frozen
When they reached an agreement, their assets were released
They had invested a lot of funds around the world


Google : 

APT 28 aka GRU Unit 26165 (Advanced Persistent Threat, in the "Hunt for the Red October, the noise heard on the submarime was unique and unidentified. Their captain asked them to note it based on behaviour")

	(russian Military Intelligence or GRU, sponsored by the russian government  ; specializes in state-sponsored cyber attacks, decryption of hacked information, uses 0-Day Exploits, Spear-Phishing, and malware ; targeted The group targets government, military, and security organizations, especially Transcaucasian and NATO-aligned states. Fancy Bear is thought to be responsible for cyber attacks on the German parliament, the Norwegian parliament, the French television station TV5Monde, the White House, NATO, the Democratic National Committee, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron)


Unit : 61398 

	(PLA's Advanced Persistant Threat Unit | 3rd Department ; Targets US companies in order to attain confidential business information and intellectual property from companies such as Lockheed Martin, Telvent, and other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors.)


Unit : 61486

	(PLA; Targets companies involved in Satellite and Communications in the US, Europe and Japan, aka.. "Putter Panda)

Unit 78020

	(PLA, aka APT 30 , aka Lotus Panda, targetted government and private sector agencies in the South-China Sea region for Espionage purposes)

Beaureau 121 



, unit 180
Charming Kitten (Iran)


When we discover a new adversary, they are given an **APT Number** a *la APT28 : GRU (Russian Military Division-Cyber)*


APT28, Politican Motivation :

Kremlin Playbook by Heather Conley --> The book describes Putin's Intentions : 

		Putin was in the KGB. During the cold war, the US was trying to get the world to adopt Capitalism. The Soviet Union wanted Communism everywhere, but they lost. People like their appetites better ... Putin recognized that the Soviet plan was not good. He had another idea: let us convince other nations to isolate themselves. How did they do so ? 
	Get them to break from Trade agreements, defense agreements, elect nationalist governments that are fixated on their countries first. You have to do other things for the people of these countries : convince the people that all their problems are the faults of other people in their society (remind them of how different these people are). How do you build this momentum? he financed and supported largely-corrupt politicians to push this agenda in all ways but specially media and internet to mould behaviour. Hitler had the same strategy, but did not have the internet. Germany was an educated and industrial country, and yet Hitler convinced them that the minority is the enemy , and to gas 6 million human beings. He took advantage of how terrible people lived. Nationalism is a popular tool. Anyone he did not like was labelled prosecuted and killed. The German people were convinced and cheered on. When Hitler fell, people awoke from this nightmare. Putin is doing the same thing. He uses foreign agents to corrupt individuals, cyber campaigns, media personalities and others to convince others to leave agreements, and to focus on immigration and other issues and blame minorities. He wants to be the strongest leader and for Russia to be the dominant nation. Russia competes actively with China (The US owes the most money to China). 

China : 


		Second largest defence budget 3.5% GDP, 610 billion)
		Industrial and economic motivations, they have 5 years plan. They want to be dominant in aerospace, advanced materials , space, weapons etc. They aim to steal everyone's achievements. Their cyber units (~100000 personnel from military and civil government), unrestricted warfare (he mentioned that advanced weapons research is quite leaky)



North Korea : 

	beaueu 121, unit 180 (1800 specialists)
	Motivations : no one knows!
	Dislikes South Korea and any other leaders disliked by their leader.
	When a student does well at STEM in school, the student gets picked, get a massive salaries 100000 USD a year, trained to graduate level, the betterment of the family's situation (this is in a country where people are so hungry they are eating Birch bark)
	The cybersecurity specialists in North Korea start learning from the age of 13. They choose the best!



Iran :

		Fourth biggest cyber force (as they think)
		Motivations : Before the birth of Israel, Iran was the US' partner. They had lots of support. Israel was born, and the Americans left their spouse. A lot of people would like to get back together with US. Iran is focused on the destruction of Israel and domninating the Middle East. Sunnis and Shias are fighting for power in the Middle East. Iran tried to dominate Egypt, Saudi Arabia via Yemen and others, they want the Middle East. When Iran started the development of nuclear weapons (they wont ever arrive), Israel interrupts them. When Iraq tried, Israeli air force bombed the Nuclear Reactor. They were never detected on radar, because radar produces a general return, in which the Israelis used to hide their planes as Iraqi plances (so the Iraqi planes do not appear on radar). 
		Nuclear agreement: They promised 100 million US in frozen funds. They took this money, and developed their cyber security force


#### When did this war start? 


The collapse of the Soviet Union:

	Russia had a plan to use the Internet.
	The 1st Iraq war 1990 : Iraq was the fourth largest army in the world, China was in a similar stance. 
	They had a huge army fighting against a coalition with a high tech weapons
	China's general staff took a close look at the 1st Gulf War, and decided to invest in technology. They produced a paper called "Unrestricted Warfare" : Distrupt soocieties of our enemies, find a way to introduce problems  including cyber and introduce an opiate crisis. They created a cyber force. 



### Hacktivists


Cult of the Dead Cow (1980s-1990s)
WikiLeaks (2006-today) : they get a lot of help from the GRU. Julien Assange started running out of money, in which the russians decided to finance them to attain top secret documents, and had an agreement to not hack russian sites. 
Anonymous (2003-today) : The early leaders of this group have built the internet. When Anonymous is doing a campaign, their actors are launching attacks from outside their target country. They are very successful. There was an election that was supposed to happen and the government authority wanted online voting. Threats came up saying that they would be attacked by Anonymous. Ron was present at a meeting where there was a person who was taking notes in the meeting. Since he was recording on his computer system, and his organization is about to be attacked, then they would know Ron is on the defence team. 
(Letia Parsons' case : online bullying, the attack was out of Bulgaria)
Social/Political objectives for these groups : agendas




### Amateurs 


	Hackers (malicious and non-malicious) (example : Rodreigez. when he was caught, he was having a party and standing at the top of the stairs and was complaigning that his fingers were sore from counting money. He hacked TJMax. They get caught because they are obnoxious, and like to announce it)

	Crackers : people who like breaking into things
	Script kiddies: They search the internet for software and exploits, they do not have other skills than running software



### Our side 


**The Five Eyes**


Canada , US, UK, Australia, New Zealand 


The First World Cyber War was in 2007 and fought in Estonia. Estonia was called East-Unia, which was the birthplace of Skype. They had phone payments in 2007. Everything was done online. They were a former soviet satellite, and had a big statue of a fallen soviet soldier. They wanted to get away from their past, but recognized that there were Estonians who were nostalgic about their soviet history. The statue was moved to the graveyard outside the city. A group of hackers in Estonia decided to fight against moving the statue. They reached out to the criminal community, and mentioned that they can not afford to engage them (small fish), but we are your people and we need your help in stopping this government. 2-3 botnet admins were lent out to them free of charge for 24 hours : a group of computers controlled by a single individual. To set up a botnet with devastating proportions (aka super computer), you need 20000 computers. The average botnet has 10000 computers. If 2 botnets worked together, they can take down a government platform. They are for hire. It is 5 dollars a bot. 

On Monday, Estonia went completely dark ( Banking health care, services etc). A lucky coincidence was that a meeting was takinig place iin Estonia for the top domain managers of the DNS systems. When typing cnn.com, the computer needs to translate the IP address to the domain and vice versa. DNSes are split amongst the different parts of the world. The bots were mostly in south America, so they shut down communications between South America and Estonia. At the end of the 24 hour period, the bots left and Estonia was back again. One of the botnets was a military botnet belonging to russia. Why would a russian military botnet get involved with Estonian hackers. Why were they involved? Estonia is a NATO country. There has never been a cyber attack against a NATO country before then. 


NATO's response: There was no response at the time. There are two possible realities : 

1. They had no defence (NATO) : Bush built a cyber defence in Estonia because he thought it was better situated there (against russia). NATO knew what the russians were aiming for, and decided not to act on Estonia. 



### Where are the fronts? 



Our Critical Infrastructure (Power, Water, Telecom, etc)

Our economy (Intellectual property in targeted industries and financial markets)

Our political institutions (elections and national policy)



He met bush, and provided a presentation of what the cyber criminals can do in 5 days with their current abilities ( shut down banking systems , shut down financial systems, the train system-rail transport tracking system - shutdown by a hurricane, the power was redirected from the center, and a car manufacturer complained that they have to lay off people if power was not restored,), air traffic control systems (planes would crash), telecommunications (unable to communicate) + power (goes back to 18th century-Hurricane Juan example - No power, no communications , no cellular service, no gas due to lack of power to power the pumps, everyone was isolated).


Economy :

	Ghostnet : they would hack into computers in large companies that were publically traded, they would listen to board meetings announcing financial results, they made billions on this intelligence. Buying stocks before the announcements. 


Influence campaigns : Destroys society. This convinces people to do strange things, such as withdrawal from NATO, protest movements, people marching in the streets driven by nationalism etc. Any source of division in a society would be used. The people themselves do not realize they are being influenced. Vaccine misinformation : GRU got the disinformation by acting on behalf of a russian pharma company). People did not know why the elections were meddled (1st time influence campaign attack against Canada, society changing activities, driving rebellion, financing and prompting extreme ideas. # campaign costs almost nothing. Now, they have massively ramped up attacks against Canada. They find public figures that will support the divisive ideas. Chasing the money comes from a political action committee paid by an anonymous donor. If we read something or listen to someone that is divisive (racist, divisive, etc), there is a good possibility that they are part of an influence campaign. They prevented Hilary CLinton from winning, because she embarrased putin repeatedly. Putin made her his focus. The campaign came physically into the US. The agent arrived on 2014 in the US. Late december, Mike Flynn got his first briefing about election assets involving intelligence hacking, and the GRU individual who managed the attack disappeared. 


Sources and methods: you tell someone something , and a limited number of people know, these people would know exactly who did what. 


Cyber gangs are situated in Belarus now instead of Ukraine, Putin is worth 100 billion annually, and putin gets a cut of all the attacks. 




### Russia : 


Goals :


domination 
vast resources 


Cyber assets : 


Foreign Intelligence Service SVR : agency concerned with collecting foreign intelligence outside the commonwealth of independent states, report directly to the president. 
Main intelligence directorate (GRU) : Main directorate of general staff of russian armed forces. an intellegence branch of the army. behind wikileaks


FSB : agency responsible for counter intelligence and other aspects of state security and intelligence gathering

Cyber criminals 
:
Mercenaries :
Wikileaks

###### IRA (Intenet Research Agency)


led by wagner's president

Intelligence Units : GRU

Accomplices : Cambridge analytica data/ behaviour scientists. 


(Russia creates barriers between itself and campaigns by using go-betweens for funding aND MANAGEMENT. fACEBOOK DETECTED THE HACK - THE ORIGINAL INTENTION WAS SOCIAL RESEARCH APPARENTLY ;) , SO FACEBOOK ALLOWED IT TO CONTINUE 





### Canada's new cyber force 


Contrary to popular belief, the aim was to stop Hilary Clinton.





Quiz : which of these social cause internet groups were established by the GRU and IRA ?

Being Patriotic
Stop All Immigrants
Secured Borders
Tea Party News
Black Matters
Blacktavist
Dont' Shoot US
LGBT United
United Muslims of America
Kids4Trump

*All of them!!!*


#### Tactics :


Hack election systems, political organizations and individuals
Infiltrate/fund groups, political parties, social and political activists : have people volunteer for riding associations which are in themselves a driving force, volunteer drivers to drive voters to pick trump etc... (Hilary supporters were being persuaded that voting for Hilary Clinton is hopeless, they convinced political supporters of nominees to abstain or vote otherwise)
Corrupt individuals (money , gifts, power , girls etc)
Blackmail/sexual extorsion
Target social media and search result feeds to specific individuals
organize at the riding levels (driving voters and not showing up)
(There are companies that make political influence campaigns) 


Example : Maria Butina, as a young student in Russia she met "coincidently" with Paul Erikson (republican strategist), and honeytrapped him. She moved in with him to the US. She joined the NRA, and invited them to moscow to film them partying/blackmail etc. She worked for Alexander Torshin who was a member of the russian government and reported directly to putin. Funded by Konstantine Nikoleav, who was a russian billionaire and a member of putin's inner circle. She confessed that her mission was to infiltrate the NRA, corrupt and influence anyone with a high level policy input. Promote friendly relations between ring wingers and russia and support trump's campaign. She served 5 months in prison, and was swapped. When she arrived in russia she denied everything and putin denied connections to her. 


### Key Points : 

1/2 a non technical problem and 1/2 technical problem 

Most of our problems originate from the lack of awareness rather than a technical deficiency. 
We are not paying attention
Bad guys are in our networks
Best defences :

	improved education
	work force growth
	data analytics



#### Why our defences are not working ?


1st world war : Germany lost , France did not want to be invaded again. France spent 20 years building the Maginot defensive fortifications between Germany and France. They wanted to make sure that germany would never be able to invade again. 


In 1940, the Germans managed to invade Paris in 7 days. They went around the defensive fortifications via Belgium. The same approach applies in cybersecurity. Canada's IT industry focused on building better firewalls. The malicious actors get in through people! The borders of the network is no longer a wall. The borders are the organization/entity's personnel. They target the things we do with our devices, surfing malicious sites, and we carry them to the local network. 


He will release Formative Assignment : no marks for this one ---> intended to get us researching. The asisgnment has two parts :

Part one : find out everything you can about your classmates (on the internet/ OSINIT) , wr
(No dark web hacking , stalking, )
Summative Assignment : with marks 

pictures, background education family members, where they work etc. How much can we find out about our classmates?  Make sure function/grammer. We can put no data under each name if there are no information 

Part I  Offensive component : How much can you find out? 

Part II : Defensive component 

Try to find information about yourself


Next Week : Anonymous, organized crime groups 


He will divide us into groups of five, and then we will focus on a nation-state
