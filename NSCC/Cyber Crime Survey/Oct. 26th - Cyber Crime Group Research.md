We will be using **Nessus Essentials (aka. Nessus : Home Version)**. We will need an email address. We will be setting up new Administrator passwords, so we **must** write them down. 









**Nessus** is a vulnerability scanner, which covers all the endpoints. It has thousands of libraries that it uses to evaluate endpoints. 



Two types of scans: 


1. Un-Privileged Scans (sans Credentials) 


	You can find a lot of information about your endpoints


2. Privileged scans 

	You would enter your credentials. It will find all the vulnerabilities on installed software and services. It will present the criticality of the vulnerability. 








Ron typically finds 200-300 vulnerabilities with the machines.



Critical vulnerabilities mean that someone can take over your endpoint with little effort. It will point you to the specific vulnerabilities so you can resolve them. Alot of it is about *patch levels*. 


The clients would ask Ron to patch their software, and Ron would reply that he would charge $200 per hour. It would be better and cheaper if they fix the endpoints themselves. 


It is very important if we are running a network , to have an outside entity to do a vulnerability scan on the network once a year. Every single organization must have a vulnerability scan. 


You would want to catch internal mistakes. If they commission one of their workers to do it, they may not catch all the vulnerabilites. You woudl have a small appliance tapped into the network, and you would schedule Nessus to scan the network for vulnerabilties every day. 



Internally, you can use  Nessus to keep up with any vulnerabilties on your network. Once a year, you would have an external entity scan your network to see if you are scanning for vulnerabilties correctly. 


The Nessus reports can span 10000 pages. You can prepare a summary report of the vulnerabilties, and arrange them from critical to low. If you find a critical vulnerability, stop right away and fix it. 



If you do a scan on Tuesday morning, and you find critical vulnerabilities. You would create a report, and if you submit the report and noone reads it, someone could compromise the system in the meantime. If you tell noone, then you would bear the responsibility. 


Ron will develop an exercise to develop our Nessus' scannning abilities. Large firms who need security/vulnerability audits, we can tell them that we are fluent with Nessus. 


All these tools represent defensive measures against vulnerabilities. 

Ron will teach us the methodology for presentations. 


> [!attention] 
> My Project : **Darkside Ransomware Gang**


Ron will rate our presentation skills. 



> [!success] 
> The key to successful presentations is **to know the subject matter through and through**.  


The framework is called **The Box Curriculum**. He needed to demonstrate this on a smaller scale to make it easier. 



Sample Topic : Hamburgers 


1. When you eat hamburgers, do you prefer a particular restaurant? 


2. Does anyone have a burger recipe that they would like to share? 



> [!note] 
>  The Recipe : 
>Ingredients (can't identify it but you can taste it)
> 
>1. Cumin 
> 2. Soy sauce
> 3. Brown Sugar


You start off with the following steps : 

1. Stand up : if you are required to do a presentation to a company, it would help tremendously if you had the audience's attention, and you stand up as a point of respect. 
2. You introduce yourself : you may have someone who does not know you .
3. Tell the audience what the presentation will be about
4. You ask questions : Do  you hamburgers at home ? you do so for many reasons. You need to assess the level of knowledge of your audience. You will then choose the appropriate vocabulary. You capture the audience's attention by making it a *dialogue*. 
5. You tell them what you will tell them
6. You tell them the contents
7. You tell them what you have discussed 
8. Post-assessment --> you are checking if the information stuck, and to see if anyone knows the answer (never ask : Do you have any questions? ). 


> [!summary] 
> Remember : Introduce yourself. Ask them questions. Gather your thoughts. Do your presentation. Do a post-assessment.

# Organized Cyber Crime 




We have looked at the volution of hackers in the past 20 years, individuals' contribution to cyber crime, prosecution ( punishment does not fit the crime vs the punishment being way worse). The courts do not know what they are doing. 


If you wish to do well, you should study law in the US and study cyber crime. We spoke about in the Gold Rush days, people who made the most money were the people selling mining equipment.


Organized crime gangs build the infrastructure the hackers use. They charge for it. Regardless of the outcome, they always make money,where it is hundreds of Billions a year. 


The US called it "Transnational Organized Crime". Their victims are worldwide. We know that when we talk about Russian gangs, their victims are elsewhere in the world, mostly developed coutnries. Unlike organized crime groups, they can be ephemeral, where they disppear. 


Sustained groups , when we consider organized crime, they are people that live as outlaws who live outside the law. They are highly respected and feared. They are generous to those who support them. Ron's neighbourhood was a gang. You existed in the gang because everyone knew you. Someone who walked into the neighbourhood that did not belong was in trouble. The police was seen as enemies. Ron was beaten almost to death by another gang. Ron's mother called the police, and the neighbourhood guys informed him not to talk to the police, and they took care of it. 


You may ask yourself, why do people tolerate them? They look after their communities. They have a social support sytem, where they pay for the young's education. The whole family would live like this for generations. Marriot's gang is very active. They started with their grandfather, who trained his kids to sell alcohoil, and the kids sold drugs and anything to make money on the side. Everyone supported them until they go against the grain. Those are sustained groups, and are very difficult to infiltrate, due to them being based on connections. There are certain gangs , such as Mazzafuca. Whoever joined them based on someone vouching for them and if that person who vouched for them was a police officer, the family of that individual was in trouble. 


They were ephemeral, where they could disappear. Hacker groups like Anonymous contained members who were unknown but respected. Anonytmous had police officers as members. 

Almost always, the motivation is financial. Luckily, they target highly-valued targets. The ransomware gangs target large organizations with critical data at risk. 


They are structured group of 3-4 persons, with a variety of escalating crimes. There are Carding groups, who use stolen credit card information.


READ TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME



They are differentiated by certain factors : 


1. Level of Integration of technology : 

		Someone who smuggles drugs uses technology to obfuscate their communications with encrypted chats. 
		
	Differentied by the malware they use 


2. Differentied b the crimes being commitied

3. Differentiated by their targers




### Categories :



## Type 1 : Groups that operate Online and Commit Cybercrime


	Hacktivists , scammer operations (use skimming technologies : little machines, waiters in big cities like Montreal). New Skimmers are slipped under card readers. It is the same technology as a POS machine. They used to use skimmer with a camera to capture the pin. You do not see the cameras anymore. In the bankinig machines, you find those cameras there all the time. Builtin boards are used to hide the cameras. Now they have a whole entire face of an ATM. When Ron's bank machine was compromised, the bank mentioned to check the front of the ATM to see if it would come off. The gas pump's keyholes are worn out often. 

### Type 2 : They operate offline and online and engate in crimes and cybercrimes


### Typ3 : Those utilizinbg information and ocmmunicatin technology to facilitate offline crimes





Core members : 



1-10 people  
Ethnic/national commuinties in big cities. They target banks with a husband and wife team, where one goes inside the bank, and the husband watches out outside. In Vancouver's chinatown, all the street signs are in Chinese. You can not infiltrate those communities, much like organized crime gangs. They have a lot of history in the old country. The meetup spot is prison. They meet in hacking/coding forums, Dark Web. They are not always technically skilled, but they chose to do it for a life time. Hells' Angels assassins are professionals, and when they land in prison, no one messes with them. They make a lot of money, and they do not pay taxes. The tax they pay is prison time. This person would never hurt anyone who is not his target 


- enablers : 

They are profeissionals for hire with special skills. It is hard to overstate how well structured this is. It is an economy within an economy 



- Foot soldiers : 

surveilance , withdrawing cash from compromised ATMS, often drug addicts. 

-MOney mules : 


How do you change the cash into cash that you can spend ? cryptocurrencies. They would have to launder the money. So money flows out of china in the millions into the real-estate market, where they will pay whatever the asking price is, and then they turn around and sell it for less than they paid to get clean cash. Moving the money around is difficult. There was a bad bank called Zeus, where Ron's friend took it down.  They put ads in the newspaper and online forums in North America, "Work from Home in the financial industry" : someone wires 9000 dollars, and you would transfer it to the Ukraine. This is exfiltration of the cash 
made by Zeus, and you would think you are working from home for the financial industry. 

Personal contacts play a huge role 

Reputation plays a big role too




#### Forums 


1. For recruitment
2. Professional services ( money laundering id theft)
3. Sales rentals of botnets, RATs , Malware
4. Trade in fake or stolen goods (credit/debit cards, human trafficking, arms dealing ) : Ron's student was skilled at human trafficking, and changed his ways. 
5. Education and training : They have training programs online, just like any trade of discipline. 



## Pharma Wars 


Not very common now, but the larger gangs were taken down. 

They sold fake drugs, and the customer did not know what was in it. If someone has cancer and they were poor in the US, they were easily swayed by cheap drugs online - Canadian pharmacy international.

You have a sponser and an affiliate program, who had made money as a percentage. Spamming made a lot of money for everyone who did it. If 1% of peolple that responded to spam emails, that is a lot of people. If each person paid 200 dollars, they keep 40% of the gross revenue. Some money goes back to illicit drug manufacturers. They can be set in many countries like india , afganistan. They pay into infrastructure providers. Macculo was an infrastructure provider. Payment processors : How would you accept credit card payments online ? there are companies set up , much like VISA, and the credit card companies themselves. On this side, you have the victims who are the customers. They are well financed , trained individuals supporting a massive global economy. PARTNERKAS in Russian. you can do this if you paid the right people, and you would not attack your home country. Some intelligence divisions in Russia had to work for a work term with these groups. Sometimes they have to cooperate with them. Noone would be able to say no if they demanded the individual's services (GRU). Why does not this exist elsewhere? we are not specifically speaking about russia. In teh former soviet block countries like Azerbaijan, lots in the Ukraine (before the reosolution, and after the resolution tehy went back to belarus , were mostly belarusians). With China, their armed forces are responsible for this. They have criminal gangs working on the same model, but do not have the level of infrastructrue as the russians.

Observe the revenues. The orders came from countries without public health care, countries with the highest bills for healthcare, such as Azthma medication , cancer medications. There are dark web forums with illicit drugs involving Fentanyl , heroin who are different than these groups. 


Alot of the network infrastructre goes up and down all the time, so it is hard to pin down the location, so they use proxy servers. There are encrypted URLS in the malware, and it functions for one day. The urls are registered for one day, and another url for another day. 

There was someone who was trained by Ron's mentor who infiltrated these groups. If you make the costs higher than the revenue, then they stop doing it. It is difficult to know the amounts they make. He got into their networks by developing his own malware, appeared on people's websites with ads for pharmacies , and the only thing that did not work for him was the checkout button. He got into trouble for that. 


## Attacks


Cryptocurrency miners : They infilrtae the network, make your pc part of the botnet, mine crypto. Imagine if someone placed a cryptominer on every computer to mine crypto. 



Network based attacks : DDPS, Worms to build botnets 


In person Social Engineering, phone calls , moles , scammers : with spam, online ads




 Spamit and Glavmed 


![[Pasted image 20231026145053.png]]


Some individuals go to countrties, study as foreign students, do well , get hired 
 by companies and proceed with their activities. 



![[Pasted image 20231026145207.png]]



Pavel vurvlevsky : Founded Chronopay. russian equivalent of spiderman's kingpin. he was a biollionare who started food banks for the poor. He is very wealthy and protected. He did time in prison, nickname : redeye




Igor gustev : spamit/glavmed, Dark Masters



Mikolai Mikolo , he founded Nikolo, he recently became a father, he and his friend were in a porsche that they did not own. Lost control of the car  (This is the guy who Had the Nikolo infrastructure). His funeral was like a funeral from the godfather. His infrastructure ran criminal enterprises.

## New Model : Cooperating gangfs

they shared code, hosting services, delivery serivces, shared information on victoms 


![[Pasted image 20231026145726.png]]


Lockpit and srphet gangs formed an empire : this is meant to show us that each gang does a specialty, and each gang did a part of the operation. They formed a cartel **Mikolocore**

> [!todo] 
> Google the Darkside Ransomware Gang. We are tasked with writing a paper, giving a 5-minute presentation, and we will be assessed on our research and presentation skills. No more than 3 slides. Slides are roadmaps. We do not want the audience looking at the slides. We never need to look at the slides ourselves, this is a kiss of death. There will not be much text on  the slides. We have bulletpoints to guide us , and it is for teh audieence to knwop what is coming.
