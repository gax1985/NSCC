# TODO



In the next few minutes, we can check out the Cyber Crime Survey's assignment



#1 Review the instructions for the presentations portion of this assignment (If presented, think about if you have hit the marks) (if not presenting, if you have noticed something missing from their presentation, keep track of it to avoid it in our presentations)


Imagine you have been hired for your Cyber Security job. You are giving a presentation for all the senior members of the company. Consider what that presentation will look like. Imagine the delivery method, interaction with the audience, information, etc... 


Presentations are a cause for people losing their jobs in Cyber Security. We need to be able to communicate what we have ;earned to others. We are the keepers of this knowledge; we will be hired by organizations that do not know it, and they depend on us delivering this information to them. Ron got a lot of awards, promotions and others in his career based on his ability to talk to crowds well. He was not always like that.
