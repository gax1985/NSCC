# Basics of Cybersecurity Planning



#### Assets 


We have to categorize the following assets :


##### People

There are risks involving disgruntled individuals for example, negligence or lack of knowledge in regards to cyber security hygiene


##### Equipment

There is a concern of *vulnerabilties*. If the vulnerability exists, we have to fix it. 

##### Information


##### Physical Assets 



##### Reputation 


If our router costs $10000, and the damages of not having this asset is 1 million, then it would tell you something about its inherit value. 


We are trying to figure out how much money it takes to protect the asset  

We *value* them 

We *categorize* them

We figure out the *threats* to the assets 





We are trying to discover ports involving the following categories : 


- Allowing **Communications** 

- Allowing **Connection and Control**

- Allowing **File Transfers**



Most common causes : 


- Programs being uninstalled, but ports being left open 

- Malicious intent, where someone could have installed a backdoor into the infrastructure

- Silly individuals, who either through negligence or due to lack of knowledge or with a malicious intent leaving a door open
