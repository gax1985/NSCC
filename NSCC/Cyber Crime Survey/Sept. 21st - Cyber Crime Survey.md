First assignment is up on Brightspace


#### Status of the Nation-State Teams


If you are not on a team, you have two choices : 


1. Try to join a team !
3. Form a new team!



What you do is ....

Sit down and figure out the logistics :

1. Meeting times : twice a week!
2. Chatting : Discord (a method of communication)
3. Figure out who is doing what : Tactics, Resources , Motivations and Historical Perspectives (go back as long as it is pertinent: 1960s-), handing communications for meetings, taking notes, etc... (If someone is not showing up or contributing, you can respond for offers of compassion and assistance. If the person does not respond positively, we should let him know as soon as possible, and this person gets kicked out and loses the grade for the assignment). 
4. Record everything in a report and send it! 
5. He will meet with us as we go through this process on a minimum of once a week.
6. Manage the squad as a squad!


He guarantees that SOMETHING is going to happen : a challenge! 

It could be difficulties with meeting (logistics : cant find resources, spaces to meet, etc , we bring it up with him )

### Formative Assignment : Due Sept. 26th !


Report the class list as we have it. Do a decent job by Tuesday! 

We get 24 hours of a grace period!


-------------------------------------
We have a long list of hackers on a list for a good reason. They are involved in cybercrime in the past 25 years. Write a report on each person 1 page long. It is a good idea to give each dosier a unique number/label. He will give us time today to get started in class. 

### Due Date : Oct. 12th 11:59:59 

	With a 24-hour grace period. 

	(If unable to meet the grace period, come speak to Ron immediately as soon as you are aware) --> Family emergencies, health problems, conflicting schedules.


Ron is here to help us. He is happy to help us complete our work and learn. We are being trained. If we make mistakes or break things, our classroom is the place to do it. Behave professionally!


Do NOT have this conversation : on the due date or the day before the due date "I know it is due today or due yesterday, I thought I could finish it this week, but I could not". In the workforce, if you do this, you get fired. 


Break up into groups/teams, and figure out nation-state logistics. We can start right away, or start on the assignment he just issued. 


We have training on referencing now.


This morning : National Protest came out of nowhere . Million March objecting to students learning about gender identity, children's rights, etc. Nationally-coordinated protest. 

Every time we see something well-organized and divisive, do a little digging : who organized it ? who funded it? 


All of the strategies Russia has used around the world, especially in the US since 2016 , it was noticed by other groups, whose agendas could be something completely different. These are professional political consultants who handle Facebook posts and social media campaigns , etc. The question always is "Who is behind it?" It could be innocent, but then again, it should be investigated.  The agenda behind it is important.
