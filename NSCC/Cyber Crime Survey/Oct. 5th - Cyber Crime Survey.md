Assassination in BC : The assailant fled Canada immediately afterwards. The second target was not killed, so the intelligence services have a 'Duty to Report', which is "Someone is trying to kill you.", but that is all they would say. The hit squad could still be here in Canada. Today, another Sikh activist that died in June in the UK. He died from bloodclots, which was unrealistic because he was perfectly healthy, and he was killed in June. 


Years ago, there were alot of incidents of religious violence. There were two groups of people, with members of one group masqurading as giving radios away. They did attacks like that, and these radios were bombs. This is happening again. 


Putin paved the way for this situation. He is going to the UK and killing dissidents, and India is doing the same now. 



We are at a point where we are working on the Hacker Profiles, and the deadline is **Oct. 12th**. After this assignment, we will mvoe onto another section. 


We will be moving into the **Types of Attacks **. 


One of the things we would do is a **Risk Assessment**.

Risk = Probability X Impact


We will learn a new formula, for when we have a LOT of risk challenges; a situation where there are problems everywhere. This formula is JUST for us !


National Standards Institue of the US

#### NIST 

They published the **Cybersecurity Framework, The Risk Management Framework, and other Frameworks that we MUST learn!**


A good deal of graduates are being hired right now to be moved into Risk Management. They all can run through the NIST Frameworks in their sleep. They learned it with their new employers. There are families of controls that exist within the NIST framework, and each family has something to do with security. There might be a family that deals with access control. Amnd each family has sub-controls. 

1. Do they have unique usernames and passwords?
2. Do they have roles and responsibilies for each position?  

The organization would need to produce a published policy. They have to prove it! The policy + the demonstration of the establishment of this policy. 


There are 1200 controls. Not every control applies to every organization. As we are doing out assessmennt, we go control by control by control by sub control etc...

If they fall short, or fail the risk assessment, they would have to modify  their practices to come in line. They would receive certification from NIST, and it enables them to do business with the federal government. You would need to have an entity come and assess the organization for the NIST certification. 


This discipline is highly-structured, and it is done this way due to the vast number of problems that we deal with. How would we start to tackle this problem ? 


If we get successful through the NIST guide, it would open doors for the organization. 


Take your time to read through it! 


Description : 


We have a ladder, and someone is trying to climb up. The steps have a huge gap between them. Add little steps so we can understand the subject better. NIST framework fits this model. 


Any portion that we can accumulate before we go for our career's beginning, Ron guarantees that this is REQUIRED. 



## Hacking Techniques 



Which attack vectors do we have to deal with today? 


We will discuss the prevalent attacks : 


#### 1. Network-Based Attacks 


Focused on making the network unsuable. It would be knocked down, a type of Denial of Service attack is common. 


It is a constant firing against the firewall to a point that it can not function anyhmore.

A powerful computer with many VMs configured as a Botnet. There is a lot of traffic to fill its memory and bog down its CPUs. 


The most common way is DDoS, which involves a Botnet, with often unwilliing participants (indirectly by someone jacking their computer to be part of this DDoS Botnet)


Anonymous would ask for recruits in a campaign, to download a piece of software , for example LOIC (construct packets and fire them at networks) and HOIC.  


A few years ago, a Content-Delivery-Network, or CDN, was taken down by a DDoS attack in Northwestern US./ When you visit Facvebook, you are not going to Seatle, you are dealing with a content deliver ntwork so you would connect through a proxy for better speeds. The content delivery network was used to enable better service for Facebook, Twitter, etc... 

This DDoS attak did not come from computers. It came from home-security cameras that had default passwords , and exposed to the internet. People usualy neglect to change the default credentials. Attackers comrpomised them and turned them into bots and attacked the CDN> Any network attached device that is publically accessible could be jacked to participate in these attacks. 


Fundamentally, hackers would have nothing to steal in the school's network, but having the computer itself as a part of the botnet is quite important for them. 


If we are a rental business in Truro, and we have 25 compyuters in a bulding, the question may arise"  who would attack us? ". The local hacker could put bots on these computyers, and the hacker could sell the technical resources as a part of a larger botnet for a price. IT depends on the quality and size of the network, who is the buyer? There is a business behind this. Attackers want to maintain reputation in the criminal world. 


Ron checked for the rental costs for one bot, and it was CAD 5 per bot. 


Most people renting botnets do not need that many bots. Someone who was in the sneakers' business rented botnets to shutdown their competitors website. 


There are many different versions of this, but they all fall within the same type : overwhelm resources. It is one of the most common attacks. 


Most DDoS attacks are not that big and not that sophisticated, but they can take down government resources. It would be used for a multitude of reasons. 


in 2015, when russia invaded Ukraine, before the troops crossed the border, all the telephone lines in Eastern Ukraine was shut down.  The Ukrainian government services used the same German-made accounting software. Russian hackers comrpomised this comapny years ago, but then decided to act right before the invasion. 



You can have network attacks from the inside ! Accounting softrware is a good example of that. 


Canada has NATO Cyber wargames. in 2017, Canada defended against the US, and Canada won. Canada was on the defensive, and the US was on the offensive. Canada won because the head of defence told everyone to assume they were already in the network. He mentioned that theyt do not knwo where they are, but they monitored every machine in their building. They hardened the outter shell, but as an extra line of defence, they put monitors on every system. Attacks emerged from devices already inside the faculities. 

The russians knew that, and they do that. You can not break into the russian ministry of defence, and plant a trogan or malware, to be used many years later, because it would be an act of war. 


The US issued the John McCain Act, which included the rights of the forces to defend by breaking into any place that they can, and place malware everywhere. Because if the day comes where Canada is expected to fight in the cyber space, then Canada would be more than ready. 


The attacks can emerge from within. One rule of thumb : be very careful of attaching devices to the network that look innocent, such as IoT devices. We can do defensive techniques, but if there is no device to be compromised, then there is no risk! 


Every manufacturer want an IoT device in every home. 


Ron mentioned that NS Power wanted a new power meter installed. It was a digital meter on the house, so they do not need to send a technician to read the meter. Ron declined this device, because he uses Internet-over-Power lines. He mentioned that he needed his assurances that this meter can not monitor his network traffic. It took them three months , and contracted a senior engineering firm in Ottawa. He got an answer of "No" without any clarification. 


For light switches, or thermostats , thermostats can be programmed to switch to a certain temperature. So if the computer is compromised and the device is attached to the network, it is vulnerable! Everyone will know if the default password is not changed. 


Xboxes and PSes : The camera was facing the wall when the Xbox is not in use. It is after all an internet connected camera.  


North America has a huge problem with webcams. Malware could be distributed through games, or some app to make the computer faster. For a while, they sold laptops with a webcam door. 


Smart-TVs : They are connected to the internet, and if they have "Hey Google!" they are constantly listening. Alexis is the same way. Ron is against anything in his home that is listening to everything he says, as they gather every word to see if he wants the device to do something. The data goes into a profile! 


Ron mentioned that he was teaching another class, and demostrated that the Data market about us, where specific data on us, websites what we like , every email, every SMS, all used to build a profile on each person. On every website, they collect a ton of information. This allows organizations to tailor your experience on the internet , and targeted ads. 

Confirmation Bias : it takes the individual's train of thought, and reinforces it on and on. ..


Any device that can collect data in our environments is a potential threat, because they can all be compromised and end up in a DDoS.



## End-Point Attacks



They deal with compromises against phones, desktops , laptops. Most of them, we get them from the **internet**. YOU is the attack vector.  


You have to be VERY careful of online practices. If you are doing dangerous things, you can do it on a computer that is not connected to anything critical. 


Any attached device  : 


	Anything that can be attached to a computer represents an Attack Vector. 


#### Wireless Attack Vector 


One of the easiest! We will do a lot of that. 


#### Bluetooth Attack Vectors


Bluetooth is usually always on. so it is anything that could get into your endpoint. 



Question about VPNs: VPNs do one thing : it makes it hard for anyone to capture your traffic from your endpouint to where you are going. They do not protect you from anything across this channel. You can get a Driveby Download from a porn site, because it is still data. You can still be able to get malware. 

Driveby **Downloads**

We will discuss VPNs next semestar


During the pandemic , the schools put QR codes on doors. So in the morning the person would scan the QR code to sign in or log the time. Ron asked the school to put glass over it. If the QR code is under glass, you can see if someone tried to put another QR code sticker over it. 


We will do experiments with Endpoint Protection Systems


We will discuss protections in our networks. Alot of it will come from a course in January "Firewalls VPNs and Endpoints"


"Every thing in our environment represents a possible attack vector".


This is the Wild-West! Any publically-facing organization would be overwhelming to assess , so we need to priotize time and effort. There are a  lot that we discussed, but a structured approach is needed. 



#### Risk Avoidance


We can avoid risk completely. If we advertise to the world that we handle credit card payments ,the n you become a target. We can avoid risk by not doing risky things. 


There was one entity that had a public ad campaign that they provide protection against hacking (Sobeys got hacked). 


The AirMiles, Scene+ cards are used by companies to gather data about the individual and sell it.


#### Risk Mitigation


We try to make it less impactful or less probable. It is trying to find ways to REDUCE risk. Can we make the probability less ?


#### Risk Transfer 


aka. Insurance companies. You take all the risk and transfer it to the insurance company. You would be charged a premium to do so. 



#### Risk Acceptance


Every time you go up a set of stairs, there is always a risk of you falling down. Since we go up and down the set of stairs, there will be a risk. We can mitigate it, but we have to accept that as a fact. 


Highway 102 is very risky! We accept the fact we have the risk. 



What if the risk is less than the cost of trying to mitigate it? 

aka - someone could break into my place and steal the Keurig Machine. It would be possible to put a massive padlock worth a 100 dollars to mitigate the risk is ridiculous for a 40 dollar machine. Just ACCEPT it if it costs more to prevent it. 


Question : Reputational impact : it is not just about the money or assets. It is more than that. The customers will not trust the organization. 



#### Risk Assessment : What is the Likelihood of this happening? 


What are the chances of it happening? What are the consequences ? 

What can go wrong ? 






What can we do about it? If we are asking the boss for costs to cover a necessary preventitive measure, we should highlight the costs in terms of damages from a cyber attack. 

Measures should cost LESS than the value of the asset. 


The maximum we can ask for is 100% of the cost of the asset. 



Threat analysis as a customized work. 


## Design

## Reference 

## Threat 



Every organization has a different set of threats as compared to another. A pharmacy or a Grocery store for example need different requirements. Each will have a subset of risks that overlay everyone else (common threats like thefts, fires , floods, etc ...). We would have to reference that, and we have to update and monitor this threat. If we can subscribe to a service where there owuld be a notification of the organization's name is being mentioned on the Dark Web , that would be quite in depth. 




#### Vulnerability Analysis 


Could be very lucrative ! You would be looking for vulnerabilities.




You got to have a threat, an asset that is valuable, and threat actors that want the asset. thus , there IS risk. 



Risk = Pa X (1-Pe) X C onsquences


Risk = Probability of an Attack (measured from 0-1) X (1 - Pe) X Consequence (impact - can put any measurement we want )



The only thing that is important is proportizing risk management based on the value of teh assets. The bigger risk score is on top. Do NOT show this formula to others. 



1-Pe is difficult (Pe is Probability of Interuption X Probability of Neutralization)

Pe                 ==                Pi (Probability of Interruption)              X                what we can do about it 
 
                                                 We can detect the attack                     X                   We can defeat this attack 




We express these numbers as 



What if Pa = %100


E = Pa X (1-Pe) X C

  = 1  X (1-0) X 100

 = 100 (Worst-possible scenario)'
 
 
 
 Pe = Pi X Pn
 
 
 
 
 Exercise : 
 +++++++

###### Which of these events is worthy of our efforts? 

Event 1 


Pa = 0.9 
Pi = 0.5
Pn = 0.6 
C = 0.9



R = ( 1 - (Pi X Pn) ) X C







Event 2


Pa = 1 
Pn = 1
Pi  = 1
C   = 0.5



R =  Pa X ( 1 - Pe ) X C



We have to figure out where we are in the *Attack Phase*. We have to be in the pre-attack phase. We have to know our systems, understand the assets, understand the vulnerabilities, and then prevent them. Because an attack has not happened, that still means we have a lot to do still. 


If there is a hurricane coming, are we prepared for it ?




#### Post Attack : Learning from the Mistakes



How did the attackers hurt the institution? what could have been done? What can be done better next time? How we spend our time? 


Why is this the worst possible circumstance ? 


Pa = 1 
Pe = 0 
C = 1



If we will do risk management, the equation allows you to focus your attention on your day-to-day basis. There is an old story in Computer Science from the 1960s. After a couple of years, the computers were isolated. They found print jobs that waited for 6 years, because they were deemed low priority. Regardless of your risk score, you increase it with time. If the risk is 10% , I know it now. If we do nothing , it becomes larger and larger...


In a lot of attacks, vulnerabilities were known, but nothing was done.




Translate things that are not mapped to this formula! 


Ron walked in into a government organization where the password rules dictated that the user use part of their initials , and provided a list of names.  


Cause ? 


1980s CFOs model : Chief Financial Officer : Accountants were the first to have computers. CFOs like the powerful position they were in, so they had no IT personnel because they wanted no competition to this powerful position. We will look at the situation, and measure what is worth more than another measure. In order to implement a security measure, we would need to come up with a specific financial incentive for it.
