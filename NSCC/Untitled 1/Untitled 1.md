## Thinking like an Innovator

Anyone can be an Innovator. The difference is if you can think of yourself as an innovator, and if you have a customer. Users inform everything we do to create a product. This is the biggest difference between software development and user experience innovator. We will be discussing a different approach. We won't say which method is better, but we will be looking at a different way of navigating the unknown. There is no instruction manual to your destination. 

We will look at four guiding principles that will help us discover our innovation. 

## Cove 

It stands for these four ideas : 

1. Curiosity drives the whole process. All your questions are "why"
2. Originality in the sense of no one has done it before. The more original it is, the more premium the reward will be. 
3. Value : Both relate to the idea of the value in terms of how much the user cherishes the experience. Both are a result of curiosity and originality.
4. Empathy refers to 'walking into their shoes'. Really try to feel how they feel. We will discuss empathy methods. It will be the real secret that will lead to originality. 


Of these four, **value** is the most important ; it has the emotional connection to the user, and the financial value is the subtext of innovation. We create things to improve society, and to benefit the developer. 

Empathy is how you discover what will be valuable to people. 

This is the lifecycle of technology innovation. 



## Value Creation

turning your understanding of a problem into an idea and the idea into a solution. 

Problem -> Idea -> Solution

It would be great to turn an idea into a solution that makes a positivie difference to someone else. 


Ideas come by analyzing customer's problems, and converting the idea into a solution. 


## Value Capture 

In financial terms, it refers to financial transactions. But here, we are dealing with "Lightning in a Bottle". People Think easily more than saying it, and saying something is easier than writing it. This is placing lightning in a bottle. 

You have to contain that, and show it to someone else. You protect it, so they can not take advantage of it themselves. 

Our instructor had experienced an idea while walking to the bus, where he was inspired about the whole finished concept, which he spent years on. 

Capturing an intangible thing, that you can not see, touch or hear. The trick is to give the idea form so others can see it, feel it and experience it. Protecting the idea is critical. 


## Value Exchange 

You have had an idea, you formed it unto a tangible repeatable form , such as repeating a service consistently, when you do value exchange is trading someone else using your idea for financial gain.


On a high level, we have discussed the stages of technological innovation. You convert the idea unto a solution. The solution has to be valuable to other people, and you establish it in a repeatable form. 


Here is the big difference : 


#### Software Development 

IDEA -> Solution -> Repeatable form -> Income 

It is a linear process. Here is the difference in our apprach of technological innovation :


#### Our system

Idea --> Testing --> Refining it --> Test it -> Solution --> Repeatable form --> Income


This is a continuous cyclical process. 



## How do we start ? 


Taking a class is a great start. Here is some of the recommended focus .:


"The best technology leaders have the deepest understanding of the engineering and product design" . --> Larry Page, Google


"Technology by itself is not enough : It needs to be mixedwith humanity, with liberal arts, married to the humanities, makes our hearts sing, and goes beyond technology "


"Poetic Science" --> One of the earliest founders of computer science. Ada Lovelace is the foundational thinker that gave start to computer science. She called it a Poetic Science. 


#### The Power of Collaboration

The true value of new products is collaborating with others. Ideas themselves come from a collaboration. People are constantly combining and sharing perspectives, and one idea sparks another, which sparks another and so on. It goes and goes through the breezes. 


"Steve Jobs video "

One of the things that hurt Apple was John Skully getting a disease : thinking that a great idea is 90% of the work. The problem is there is tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a new idea and a new product. You learn alot more, and there are tremendous playoffs where you can not make electrons do, make factories do, make robots do. ... these 5000 concepts in your brain, fitting them together in new ways that you want. Everyday you discover something new to fit together brilliantly. The process is the value ...



### How do we become Developer Magicians ?

This is a high level scheme of the process. We will look at different stages every week, and we will connect over value creation. 

How can one engage and get genuinly fresh new interesting ideas ? everyone does it, and there are many methods we will discusss.

We will discuss how we take an idea, how we see the idea, and how to help change it. How can you make sure you are protecting the idea for yourself? People are reluctant to share the idea, as someone might steal it. 

Finally, you can trade it for an economic value. This can be the startup company you are working for. We will discuss these aspects. 


#### Philosophy 
Most technology developed today focus on the product and its value to the user. It is thinking about who is using the product. This curiosity is how you discover the solution to this problem. It is one thing to build a better iphone, but it is better to do something completely new that no one else has done before. 


### The process 


Door Opener vs Door Stopper --> Defining the problem leads to defining a solution 



## Exercise 


Pick any of these problems :


I waste time waiting because I cant find a study space close to my next class...
The washing machine is always busy when I come with my dirty clothes
My roommates I can't decide on cleaning schedules ...
I have trouble staying awake in class ...
My reusable water bottle is empty when I am in a test 


We will do the break , and then afterwards, we will think for 5 minutes.


There has been a study in Stanford University where they have determined that individuals have 6 thoughts per minute.

The dough practice is to **create a problem** and **create a tangible solution**. It is an exercise to call up our imaginations. This is a kickstarter for the three main principles for course concepts : 


## Creative Confidence

People think they are not creative due to them not drawing too much. It depends on having a creative outlet of any kind. Creative Confidence is the ability to show something incomplete, imperfect. We are all driven to be less judged; no one wants to be judged as anything but superb. Sometimes, great ideas are plenty, but the incubator idea is a huge step forward in working to communicate with others in a creative environment. 

This is showing something imperfect confidently without fear

## Build - Measure - Learn 


You build something to gauge reaction --> Learn from the feedback you get --> Build again. 

This is the repetitive cycle. What you are learning grows more and more. It is the system of getting an idea, applying it, gauging others and you get the go-ahead signal from learning. 

Thomas Edison , the innovator of the light bulb, said "I never failed; I have learned a thousand things that do not work. "

This is *continuous trial-and-error*


## Falling in Love with the Problem ... not the Solution!

If you think deeply about the problem, you come up with a solution, you fall in love with the solution, and you keep salvaging the solution ---> road to unhappiness. Think of the real problem more than the solution. 

## Stay Curious




#### Is this course about coding , communications or business? 

It is not about any one of those things, but they are pieces about the three. We do product development, some degree of software work as they apply from talking to customers and investors. 

The biggest thing is how to *deeply understand* **user needs** and how they can tell us about **innovative solutions**


# Tasks 

Any HACKATHON or any INDUSTRY SHOWCASE event. Held by Shiftkey Labs between now and April 8th, 2026 

Deadline - April 9th, 2025, at 2359 AT

Details are on Brightspace. You can submit this anytime between now and the end of the term. 


Keep a **Project Journal** for the whole term. You submit it on the last class. The last class is the **31st of March**

Buy a **hardbound notebook** (any make as long as it is hardbound) --> We will do this to create a permanent record of your intellectual thinking. It needs to be hardbound -- This is called R&D journal, Lab Journal, IP Journal


## Team Project

Conceive, research and deliver an original minimum viable product ("MVP"). This is not meant to be where one team member creates an idea 

It has the following parts : 

1. Preparation as a team  (Team Mark -> 4%)
2. Pitch as a team (Team Mark -> 3%)
3. Individual contributions (Your Mark -> 7%)


## Course Activity Points (CAPs)

Posting original day one project - 0.5
Submitting relavent and reliable news articles about innovation - 0.5
Doing a team standup - 0.5
Submitting original product feedback - 0.5
Submitting original pitch feedback - 0.5


He will post news articles about tech innovation every year. Contribute original news stories. Teams have to report on their progress every week. You give feedback on your product. You can mix and match to earn these points. 


There will always be an entry for what we are asked todo. Tomorrow or Thursday,m there will be reference slides for each lecture for that day. 

By Thursday, we should see the updates. 

## Exam 

There is a **midterm** and a **final exam**. 

Midterm is 15% and final is 50% 

Midterm is optional. 


Midterm --> We will spend time in class on practice questions, just so to get comfortable with how the questions are structured, the number of questions, and so on. 

**Biggest thing he is trying to do is to avoid *memorizing a bunch of things*. It is important to have a rich understanding of the concepts in order to *apply them* ...

The best way to study for this course is to, each week, try to follow the lectures. Think about the stuff we talked about, and think about how you can apply it to other situations. He would like us to leave with a command of the ideas, not the memory of the ideas. 

The topics are in the syllabus. 


If you can not come to the class, this will except you from the quiz. You can not use an SDA to create a three-day extension to an assignment.
