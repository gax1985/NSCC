# Evolution of Hacking 


Hacking has been around for centuries. Hacking, as a modern concept, begun in the 1950s in MIT, as they had to reserve time via time-sharing. In the 1970s, we had **phone phreaking**, where routing equipment is tricked into providing free calls locally and internationally. In the 1980s, **War Dialing** involves randomly calling phone numbers to connect to hosted games via open modems. Personal computer prices became common in the 1980s, and this ushered in the late 1980s phenomenon of viruses, worms and so on.

*Things that need to be secured* -> **Data**
It can be provided to organizations or stored on personal computers. They are a high priority.

## Bug Bounty
Some companies like to pay ethical hackers to discover their systems' weaknesses and security gaps. This could include software engineering, network engineering and system security. Those who seek vulnerabilities notify the organizations instead of exploiting them.
