We can evaluate propositions if either **true** or **false**. 





We can symbolize a proposition qwith a letter : 



>p = [ I Went to the Park ]
>~p = [ I did not go to the park ]




P                           Not P 
T                              F
F                              T




How about two propositions : 


P                Q                ~P             ~Q






Regardless of the truth table, we will create a number of rows under the following equation : 


we need 2^n rows in a truth tabvle , where N is the number of propositions, thus ...



2^(6) = 



We can symbolize the "And" Operator as being true of **BOTH** two promopsitions with ^ or *and* operator, so : 


p = { I went to the park yesterday}
q = { I saw a moose }
p^q (p and q) = I went to the park yesterday and saw a moose 




Now we have the **OR** operator 

p = { I went to the park yesterday}
q = { I saw a moose }
p v q = { I went to the park yesterday, or I saw a moose} 

--> one of these is true


P               Q                  P






And **XOR** : 


It is ONLY true when one of the propositions being assessed is true 


if both are true, it returns FALSE


Exclusively, **one** of these CAN be true



When analyzing propoistion ,


How do we draw a truth table for not(p and q) or p?


We are trying to assess not(p+q) or p


When we have an expression like that how do we assess it ?


We have two proporsitions, create two columns for p and q 


We have four propositions, so 2^4 

We double it with rows  


() P + Q )

Isolate propositions that we have, and we build them step by step 


P + Q 

Not(P+Q)

and so on 










Equivalence : 



We have truth tables, and representing the same value : 


It evaluates to all true on the last column, If we are solving this expression 




Morgan's Law : 


When I have NOT (P or Q) we have *not P* and Not Q

not(p or q)






Exercise : 


Build truth tables 


Not p and not q

( Will it be true if p = true and q=false?)


(p V q) ^ (~p V r)
