We will do **Windows** and **Linux** OS security!



Instructor :  **Tony Verbek**

		Started with a company that sold external drives for Mac and Unix sytems.



### Course (OSYS1020)

Computer Hardware

Operating System Essentials

Windows 
Linux


OS Hardening and Tools



We will be working individually  (assignments, quizes, etc ...)

Most of the work will be done in virtual machines, in which we will set up on the external drives (he recommends 1tb SSD, but what I have is fine)


#### Outcomes 

1. Articulate hardware components and the relationship with the OS and Computer security
2. Summarize typical architecture elements of an OS, and its role in controlling computer resources (Document things! First thing that goes when people get busy is documentation of changes, and reviewing logs)
3. Demonstrate the use of basic OS shell commands and GUI applications to set up and configure a secure system
4. Demostrate approaches to configuring a secure OS.
5. Document changes and system updates to promote traceabilitt rollback as needed.
