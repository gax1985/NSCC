The following [outline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_\(list\) "Outline (list)") is provided as an overview of and topical guide to ethics.

**[Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics")** (also known as **moral philosophy**) is the branch of [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong [conduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_\(philosophy\) "Action (philosophy)").[^1] The field of ethics, along with [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics"), concern matters of [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_\(ethics\) "Value (ethics)"), and thus comprise the branch of [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") called [axiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiology "Axiology").[^2]
