This guide is designed for high-retention "cramming." It breaks the material down into three "Modules" based on your uploaded files, using memory anchors and comparison tables to help you visualize the differences.

### **Module 1: The Legal Standards (The "Rules")**

*Focus: Knowing what evidence gets accepted in court and why.*

#### **1. The Two Major Standards (Frye vs. Daubert)**

This is the most common comparison question. Remember it as **"The Crowd vs. The Gatekeeper."**

| Feature | **Frye Standard (1923)** | **Daubert Standard (1993)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The Core Test** | **General Acceptance** | **Scientific Validity** |
| **Who Decides?** | The **Scientific Community** (The "Crowd") | The **Judge** (The "Gatekeeper") |
| **The Question** | "Do most experts agree this works?" | "Is this method scientifically reliable?" |
| **Key Factors** | Just one: Is it generally accepted? | **4 Factors (The Checklist):**<br>

<br>1. Has it been **Tested**?<br>

<br>2. Has it been **Peer Reviewed**?<br>

<br>3. What is the **Error Rate**?<br>

<br>4. Is it **Generally Accepted**? |
| **Pros/Cons** | **Pro:** Easy to apply.<br>

<br>**Con:** Slow to accept new tech. | **Pro:** Flexible for new science.<br>

<br>**Con:** Requires judges to understand science. |

> * **Frye** = **F**ollow the **F**lock (General Acceptance).
> * **Daubert** = **D**ad (The Judge) **D**ecides (Gatekeeper).

#### **2. The Canadian Standard (Canada Evidence Act)**

If your quiz is for a Canadian context (which your file suggests), you must know **Section 31.1**.

* **The Burden:** You must prove the **Authenticity** of the electronic document.
* **The Standard:** It is a "low threshold." You just need to show the system was operating properly at the time.
* **Key Phrase:** "The document is what it purports to be."

### **Module 2: Ethics (The "Compass")**

*Focus: Resolving conflicts between your boss, the law, and the public.*

#### **1. The ISC2 Code of Ethics (The 4 Canons)**

You must memorize the **order** (Priority) of these. If they conflict, the higher number wins.

1. **Protect Society, the Common Good, and Infrastructure.** (Highest Priority)
* *Example:* If your client asks you to hide a safety flaw that could hurt people, you must refuse. Public safety > Client.


2. **Act Honorably, Honestly, Justly, Responsibly, and Legally.**
* *Example:* Don't hack back. Don't pirate software.


3. **Provide Diligent and Competent Service to Principals.**
* *Example:* Do the job you were paid for (unless it violates Canon 1 or 2).


4. **Advance and Protect the Profession.**
* *Example:* Don't help criminals learn hacking. Mentor students.



> **Memory Hack:**
> **S.H.P.P.** (Society, Honor, Principals, Profession).
> *Think:* "Safety First (Society), Be Good (Honor), Do Work (Principals), Teach Others (Profession)."

#### **2. Key Ethical Scenarios (From your file)**

* **The "Inadvertent Discovery":** You are looking for a stolen spreadsheet but find child exploitation material.
* *Action:* Stop immediately. Report it. Do **not** keep looking (you are not authorized).


* **The "Conflict of Interest":** You are asked to investigate a friend.
* *Action:* Recuse yourself. You cannot be unbiased.

### **Module 3: Procedure & The "Chain"**

*Focus: The paperwork that keeps you out of jail.*

#### **1. Public vs. Private Investigations**

Your "Forensics and Investigations" file likely distinguishes these.

* **Public (Law Enforcement):**
* **Goal:** Prosecution.
* **Constraint:** Fourth Amendment (US) or Charter s.8 (Canada) – Limits "Search and Seizure." You usually need a **Warrant**.


* **Private (Corporate):**
* **Goal:** Business continuity, stopping a leak, or civil litigation.
* **Constraint:** Company Policy & Employment Law. You usually **don't** need a warrant to search a company laptop (it's company property), but you must use a "Line of Authority" (authorized by a manager).



#### **2. Chain of Custody (The "Holy Grail")**

Review the **Sample-Chain-of-Custody-Form.docx**. The quiz will likely ask *what* breaks the chain.

* **Definition:** The chronological documentation of the seizure, custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of evidence.
* **The Golden Rule:** If there is a **gap in the timeline**, the evidence is **inadmissible**.
* **Critical Fields to Know:**
* **Case Number:** Links the item to the investigation.
* **Item Description:** Must include **Serial Numbers** (to prove *this* hard drive is the *same* hard drive).
* **"Released By" / "Received By":** Both must sign at the *exact same time*.
* **Date/Time:** Must be continuous.

### **Rapid-Fire "Active Recall" Quiz**

*Cover the answers below and try to answer these.*

1. **Q:** Which legal standard requires the judge to act as a "Gatekeeper"?
* **A:** Daubert.


2. **Q:** In the ISC2 ethics, what is the *highest* priority?
* **A:** Protecting society/common good.


3. **Q:** What is the specific error called when a forensic tool says a file is bad, but it's actually safe?

4. **Q:** You hand a hard drive to a colleague to store in the locker. Who signs the Chain of Custody form?
* **A:** **Both** of you (You as "Released By", them as "Received By").

* **A:** General Acceptance by the scientific community.



**Next Step:** Would you like me to generate 5 distinct "Scenario Questions" based on the "Ethics Scenarios" file to test your judgment on the grey areas?
