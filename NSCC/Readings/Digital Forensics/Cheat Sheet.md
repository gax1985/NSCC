# 🚨 THE DIGITAL FORENSICS "PANIC SHEET"

### **1. THE LEGAL STANDARDS (Admissibility)**

*Remember: This determines if your evidence gets into court or gets thrown in the trash.*

| Standard | **Frye (1923)** | **Daubert (1993)** | **Canada (s. 31.1)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Nickname** | "The Crowd" | "The Gatekeeper" | "System Integrity" |
| **Who Decides?** | The Scientific Community | The Judge | The Proponent (You) |
| **The Test** | Is it **Generally Accepted**? | Is it **Scientifically Valid**? | Is the system **reliable**? |
| **Key Factors** | Consensus only. | **1.** Tested?<br>

<br>**2.** Peer Reviewed?<br>

<br>**3.** Error Rate?<br>

<br>**4.** Standards?<br>

<br>**5.** Acceptance? | Prove the computer was working properly at the time. |

### **2. THE ETHICS HIERARCHY (ISC2)**

*Memorize this specific order. If #1 and #3 conflict, #1 wins.*

1. **PROTECT SOCIETY** (Public safety, infrastructure, common good).
* *Red Flag:* Life or death, public danger.


2. **ACT HONORABLY** (Honesty, justice, law).
* *Red Flag:* Lying, stealing, hacking back.


3. **PROVIDE DILIGENT SERVICE** (Duty to client/boss).
* *Red Flag:* Doing a bad job, ignoring instructions (unless they break #1 or #2).


4. **PROTECT THE PROFESSION** (Reputation).
* *Red Flag:* Helping criminals, being unprofessional.

### **3. THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY (The "Receipt")**

*If the chain breaks, the case breaks.*

* **The Golden Rule:** There can be **NO GAPS** in the timeline.
* *Bad:* Released 10:00 AM -> Received 2:00 PM. (Where was it for 4 hours?)
* *Good:* Released 10:00 AM -> Received 10:00 AM.


* **Signatures:** The person giving it and the person taking it must sign **at the same time**.
* **Identifiers:** You must list the **Serial Number**. (Description alone like "Black Dell Laptop" is not enough).

---

### **4. "DON'T FAIL" VOCABULARY**

* **Locard’s Exchange Principle:** "Every contact leaves a trace." (The foundation of forensics).
* **False Positive:** The tool says it’s bad, but it’s actually innocent.
* **False Negative:** The tool says it’s innocent, but it’s actually bad (Dangerous!).
* **Hash Value:** The "Digital Fingerprint" (MD5/SHA256). Proves the file hasn't changed since you seized it.
* **Repeatability:** If I do the same test, do I get the same result? (Required for Daubert).

---

### **5. QUICK-FIRE SCENARIO CHECKS**

* **Boss asks you to lie?** -> Refuse (Canon 2).
* **Found illegal stuff not in warrant?** -> Stop & Report (Scope of Authority).
* **Don't know how to do the task?** -> Decline/Ask for help (Competence).
* **Forgot to sign the form?** -> Admit it in court. Never backdate.

**Good luck on the quiz! You’ve got this.**
