The “Daubert Standard” provides a systematic framework for a [trial court](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/trial_court) judge to assess the reliability and relevance of expert witness testimony before it is presented to a jury. Established in the 1993 U.S. Supreme Court case [*Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993)*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/509/579/), this standard transformed the landscape of expert testimony by placing the responsibility on trial judges to act as "gatekeepers" of scientific evidence.

The Daubert case introduced a more comprehensive approach that requires judges to scrutinize not only the expert's methodology but also the underlying scientific principles. This shift aimed to curtail the admission of pseudoscientific or unreliable [expert testimony](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/expert_testimony). Judges are required to assess the methodology and reasoning behind an expert's opinions, rather than simply relying on the expert's credentials or reputation.

Under the Daubert Standard, the [trial court](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/trial_court) considers the following factors to determine whether the expert’s methodology is valid:

1. Whether the technique or theory in question can be, and has been tested;
2. Whether it has been subjected to publication and peer review;
3. Its known or potential error rate;
4. The existence and maintenance of standards controlling its operation; and
5. Whether it has attracted widespread acceptance within a relevant scientific community.

The Daubert Standard supplanted the [Frye Standard](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/frye_standard), which focused primarily on the general acceptance of scientific evidence within a particular field. See [*Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923)*](https://law.justia.com/cases/district-of-columbia/court-of-appeals/1923/no-3968.html). While some state courts still adhere to the Frye Standard, the Daubert Standard is used in all [federal courts](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/federal_courts).

Subsequent U.S. Supreme Court cases have clarified the Daubert Standard. In [*General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136 (1997)*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/522/136/), the Supreme Court ruled that an appellate court may still review whether a trial court abused its discretion to admit or exclude [expert testimony](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/expert_testimony).

In [*Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael 526 U.S. 137 (1999)*,](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/526/137/) the Supreme Court ruled that the Daubert Standard may apply to non-scientific testimony, meaning "the testimony of engineers and other experts who are not scientists." Along with *Daubert*, these cases are often referred to as the “Daubert Trilogy.” [Federal Rule of Evidence 702](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_702) was modified based on these cases.

To challenge [expert testimony](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/expert_testimony) as inadmissible under the Daubert Standard, opposing counsel may bring a pretrial motion, including a [motion in limine](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/motion_in_limine).  Usually, a motion attacking the admissibility of expert testimony will be brought after the close of [discovery](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/discovery), with a [hearing](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/hearing) held prior to trial.
