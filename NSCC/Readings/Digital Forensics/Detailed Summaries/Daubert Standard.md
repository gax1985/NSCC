Here is the detailed breakdown for the second document.

### **Document 2: The Frye Standard (Detailed Analysis)**

*Source File: `Frye Standard.md*`

If the Canada Evidence Act is the "Rulebook," the **Frye Standard** is the "Old Guard." It was the dominant standard for 70 years and is still used in some jurisdictions (though mostly replaced by Daubert).

#### **1. The Origin Story (The "Lie Detector" Case)**

* **The Case:** *Frye v. United States* (1923).
* **The Scenario:** A defendant convicted of murder wanted to prove his innocence using a brand-new scientific invention: the "systolic blood pressure deception test" (a primitive precursor to the Polygraph/Lie Detector).
* **The Ruling:** The court rejected the evidence. Why? Not because it didn't work, but because **scientists didn't trust it yet.**

#### **2. The Core Rule: "General Acceptance"**

* **The Definition:** For scientific evidence to be admissible, the thing from which the deduction is made must be *"sufficiently established to have gained **general acceptance** in the particular field in which it belongs."*
* **How it works:**
* The Judge acts like a pollster.
* They look at the relevant scientific community (e.g., The Association of Digital Forensics Specialists).
* They ask: "Do most of you use this method?"
* If the answer is "Yes," the evidence is in.
* If the answer is "No" or "It's too new," the evidence is out.



#### **3. The "Crowd" Logic**

* Under *Frye*, the **scientific community** decides what is evidence, not the judge. The judge simply confirms what the community thinks.
* **Forensic Implication:** If you use a standard tool like **EnCase** or **FTK**, *Frye* is easy. Everyone uses them; they are "generally accepted."

#### **4. The Major Flaw (Why it failed)**

* **The Problem:** It is too slow (Conservative).
* **The "Innovation Gap":** Science moves faster than consensus.
* *Scenario:* You invent a revolutionary new way to decrypt iPhones. It works 100% of the time. You are the only person in the world who knows how to do it.
* *Frye Result:* **Inadmissible.** Why? Because it is not "generally accepted" yet. The fact that it *works* doesn't matter; the fact that it is *unpopular* does.


* **Criticism:** It prevents reliable, cutting-edge technology from being used in court until it becomes "old news."

#### **5. Current Status**

* **Federal Level:** Abandoned. The US Supreme Court replaced *Frye* with the **Daubert Standard** in 1993 (which we will cover next).
* **State Level:** Some US states (like California, New York, Pennsylvania) still use versions of *Frye* because they believe it is safer to trust the "scientific consensus" than to trust a judge to understand complex science.
