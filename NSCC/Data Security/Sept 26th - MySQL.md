a program running in the background, runs on boot va the startup files. The commandline interface we are working with communicates with the daemon through the *loopback* address, in the same way you are communicating with your server. 


The version we are looking for is 8.0.30
We need **MySQL for Visual Studio 1.2.10**
This one is asking for **Visual Studio 2019**
Now, we need to install the **Python - Connector**

We need to install **Visual Studio Code 2019** first, and we need to install the **full version** of **MySQL**.

I typed the following command after accessing the **MySQL Server Installation Directory**, which is located on the following path on the Windows 10 Virtual Machine : 

>C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin>
