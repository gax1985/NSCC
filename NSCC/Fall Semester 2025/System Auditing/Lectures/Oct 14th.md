### Friday, we have a quiz !

individual comprehension quiz  part 1 = 10% + Part 2 = 10%

4 questions  = %100 
%100 = 1 , 0 = 0

If we get all four questions correct, we score a 1, and we get it. If we get 75% on that, then our quiz results become 0.75/10. If you can not answer any of the questions, then you did not do the work. 


"What is the monitor, and what does it do?" --> collects traffic from a specific interface, configure the direction of the traffic and what type of record we want to create. (write down basic functions of the monitor)
"What does the exporter do?" --> sends the traffic to IP/Port Number.
"Which protocol is used for the exporter?" --> UDP
"If you want to track traffic coming in to your router from your traffic" --> OUT
"If you want to track traffic  going out of your subnet to your router " --> IN
