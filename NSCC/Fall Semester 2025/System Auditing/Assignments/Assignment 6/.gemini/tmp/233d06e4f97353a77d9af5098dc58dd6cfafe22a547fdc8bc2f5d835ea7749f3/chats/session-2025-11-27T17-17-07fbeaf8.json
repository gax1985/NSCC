      "content": "Based on the search results, here is a step-by-step guide to install the Context7 MCP Server for Gemini on Windows:\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have the following installed:\n*   **Node.js (v18 or higher)**: You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).\n*   **Python (3.10-3.13)**: Download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).\n*   **Gemini CLI**: Install and authenticate it by running `gemini auth login`.\n\n### 2. Install Context7 MCP Server\n\nOpen your command prompt or PowerShell and run:\n```bash\nnpx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest\n```\n\n### 3. Install Gemini CLI MCP Server\n\nIn your command prompt or PowerShell, run the following command:\n```bash\nuvx --from git+https://github.com/DiversioTeam/gemini-cli-mcp gemini-mcp\n```\n\n### 4. Configure Gemini CLI\n\nYou need to edit your Gemini CLI's `settings.json` file. On Windows, this is usually located at `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\.gemini\\settings.json`. If the folder or file doesn't exist, you may need to create them.\n\nAdd the following configuration to your `settings.json` file:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@upstash/context7-mcp@latest\"]\n    },\n    \"gemini-cli\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\"run\", \"gemini-mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Verification\n\nTo verify the installation, start the Gemini CLI and type `/mcp`. You should see both \"context7\" and \"gemini-cli\" listed as available MCP servers.",
