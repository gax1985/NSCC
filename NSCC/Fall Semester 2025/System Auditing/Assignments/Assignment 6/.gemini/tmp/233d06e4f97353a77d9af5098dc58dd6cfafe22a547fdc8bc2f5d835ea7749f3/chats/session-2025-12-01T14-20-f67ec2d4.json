It shows you're thinking about the best way to structure your data.\n\nA `list` of `lists` would work, but you'd have to access data by index, like `log[5][2]` for the month. This can get confusing and make your code harder to read, as you have to remember which index corresponds to which piece of data (e.g., index 0 is employee number, 1 is day in, etc.).\n\nUsing a `list` of `dictionaries` (which is what you'd typically get from parsing JSON, or what you can build yourself) is a much better idea. It makes your code far more readable and maintainable.\n\nFor example, instead of `record[3]`, you could use `record['HourIN']`. This is self-explanatory.\n\nHere’s a quick comparison:\n\n**List of Lists:**\n`if row[3] == 0 and row[7] != 0:` (What does 3 and 7 mean?)\n\n**List of Dictionaries:**\n`if record['HourIN'] == 0 and record['HourOUT'] != 0:` (Much clearer!)\n\nMy recommendation is to create a list of dictionaries. We can read the header row of the text file to get the keys (`EmpNum`, `DayIN`, etc.) and then process each line into a dictionary.\n\nShall we proceed with that approach?",
