> The video I picked is **Building Business Relationships**

Today, we have *Assignment 2* 



For this assignment, we had a vairety of videos to choose from : 


As Cybersecurity specialists, we would not likely have *Public Social Media Profiles*. It would be tricky to work on building trust. **Effective Listening** is very important, and we all need it. 



Today, we would write on the whiteboard our concerns, and someone else would go on the whiteboard to solve it 


We are being present in the class, and we are participating, which means we are on track to succeed. 


Last week, we should have started our *projects*. 



We should grab the **Project Document** and *fill it in*. We need a **Workplan** made up. We must be granular.  




## AI 


We should use AI, but to be used with the right intentions. In the future, we should expect to supervise AI. 



# Questions : 




## Managing your career as an Introvert 


>[!note]
>
> The Definition of an Introvert : 
>
> 	A person who cherishes being alone and muster their energy from being alone. 

>[!question]
>How would you connect with individuals if you are an Introvert ?
>
>**Answer** : 
>
>It would help to listen more! An introvert may not make the most spectacular impression, but others will know if you are honest with them and they would appreciate your efforts more!
>
 


>[!question]
>What would you do at the Job Fair if you are an Introvert ?
>
>**Answer** : 
>
>It would help to being present, the frequency of being there, listening, taking notes, thinking about what you have written, then think of questions involving what they have mentioned. The trick is : 
>
>**"Ask Substantial Questions! Ask the Best Questions!"** 
 



>[!question]
>At Job Fair , you listened, took notes, asked deep questions, went there and made a Self Introduction, and then the Job Fair is over. What has to be achieved?
>
>**Answer** : 
>
>Have a business card with your LinkedIn profile, send them an email with a LinkedIn Connection. A week afterwards, there are two types of networking : You can talk about topics not involving work ( You can not do that at the Job Fair , but if something happens where the situation involves connecting and it helps like a band T-Shirt for example). If you want a deeper relationship, you made a LinkedIn Connection, and you do not know if you had a personal connection with them, how would you follow up with them? We could check if we have a mutual connection that you have connected with in the past, and bring the individual up in a conversation. Bring something substantial, such as for example an interest in Python, something of value. You are listening for a **Connection**. If Python is useful in Cybersecurity, then we would be hypervigilent on learning Python, and then connect with them accordingly. With a professional contact, and you have bonded with someone with the Assembly Language, what would you mention about it ?

>[!Question]
>
>How do you build relationships with individuals that will have an impact on your career path ? 
>
>**Answer** :
>
> You could chitchat with them, introduce yourself more, make small connections, you can have a third person introduce you. Marc is asking, "What do you WANT?"  Until you have an idea about the path you are on, what you are doing on your path, if you approach them, it woulId be a waste of time. Take your ideas, work independently and work on them. If you want to build connections with important individuals, how would you do it? Everyone is different! *Identify Your Goals, and Identify the Right Individuals!*



>[!Question]
>
>How can you repair Trust
>
>**Answer** :
>If Trust is Broken, there is a key ingredient to mend it : Apologize, Try not to Do so Again, Repair the Damage, Demonstrate Growth ( You need to grow first ! How do you grow? ) , Consider the real reason behind the broken trust, Introspection is necessary. You have to start with yourself first : Understand what actually happened, we are blind to our flaws, and once you fully understand your flaws, you would have to find a way to fix the flaw, and after fixing it, the other person still does not trust you. Then what would you do?  You would have to change yourself, take ownership, identify the root cause, develop a solution, explain the solution.



>[!Question]
>
>How can you  Trust in a DON'TTRUSTANYONE! Society ? 
>
>**Answer** :
>
>Always Be Vigilent ( what Ron is advising ) : Is it easy to be hypervigilent? no. Some careers are happy and some careers are very sad. Marc worked in Community Services, where they dealt with a lot of misery. We are entering into a sad profession, which is more negative than positive. A more important question :
>
>**How will you avoid depression?**
>
>*Answer* : The things you love are vulnerabilties, as your hobbies could be seen as vulnerabilities. 
>





If you are at a higher level position in a company, and then you step down to a lower level , you could be a bit more powerful in that lower level in terms of respect. 




>[!todo]

>Marc wanted to show us what will happen **Next Week** : 
>
>One of the videos had **Self-Awareness** + **Personality Test**  Portion! Watch it!
