## Asking Questions to the Audience


Standing in front is tough. The other idea is to do a question-and-answer session. You can say a few things, and then ask the class a question , such as "*Emotional Intelligence*"? 


## The Audience Asking the Questions


The whole approach works, as it is not just for the breaking-the-ice mode. You can ask the audience to ask him questions instead of asking questions *to* the audience. This is most useful if you are having anxiety while doing a presentation. 


## Standing at your desk, and Present from There!


Another method : place yourself at your desk, and talk out loud! 


## Small-Group Presentations 


The old-school method!



## One-on-One Presentations


Sometimes


## Video Presentations 





## Toast Master 


It is someone who helps others give better toasts. It is run akin to a Marital Arts Dojo. They will have different responsibilities for different individuals. The standard is set, where we are required to do an intro a body and a conclusion. Second target : work on projecting your voice!


At time goes on, we would have little targets.


There are other self management or awareness!


These topics are intellectually easy. The issue is we do not do them.

# Emotional Intelligence and Stress Management 



In general, it has been Marc's experience to have **Happy Jobs** and *sad jobs*. Anyone who works with Fisheries, Natural Resources or other government sections are quite sad. In Information Technology,  it is worse. In terms of a career with Cyber Security, we would need to look at it with open eyes.
