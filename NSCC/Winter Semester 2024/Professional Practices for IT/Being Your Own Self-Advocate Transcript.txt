- How important is it really to be a strong self-advocate at work? As an author and researcher, I've asked that question of dozens of women executives. And let me tell you, I'm wowed by the answer. Women in top ranks told me that 60% of a woman's career success hinges on her ability to advocate for herself. Now, you might be wondering, what do I mean by self-advocacy? I'm talking about making a bold proposal for a new direction. Asking for more resources or better pay. Even pushing back and saying no when you've been voluntold to take on another dead end assignment. I'm Selena Rezvani, author of Pushback: How Smart Women Ask and Stand Up for What They Want, and a women's leadership speaker. I've trained thousands of women on the art of being a fierce self-advocate. I'll teach you how to do it, too. In this course we'll explore lessons from my own career, and the successful women executives I've interviewed. And we'll take a look at real world scenarios you probably face where you can stand up for yourself and amplify your voice even more. Mind you, this isn't just about being louder. It's about a mix of proposing strong ideas, expecting and handling resistance, and pushing back for what's rightfully yours. A fierce self-advocate exercises her right to use her voice. She steps into her power. Join me for practices and tools to help you move forward. After all, power looks good on you.



Organizations need to own up
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Encouraging women to stand up for themselves is one thing, and of course, we all want to stand up for ourselves, but sometimes it's hard and we need help to make it happen. That's where organizations come in. It's important that our employers help create work cultures that are advocacy friendly. You know, where women can advocate for themselves without fear of backlash. Now's the time for companies to step up, but how can they do that? Well, here are two important plays companies can make. The first step is becoming more transparent as an organization. That means talking openly about things like pay or promotions so everyone knows where they stand and how to advance their careers. Here's an example, tech giant, Cisco, has created an online bank of organization wide projects and stretch opportunities that anyone can self-nominate for. Leaders are open about what projects are available and them post them for everyone to see. They encourage women, men, everyone to raise their hands for these opportunities. When you follow their lead, you'll invite more self advocacy, especially for women. The second step is for companies to create a culture where it's okay to challenge gender bias every day. Where you and others can point out bias in action as you see it unfold. That way you can stand a chance at dismantling it, at changing behavior. For instance, one time I was on a hiring committee filling an internal team lead role. It was down to two strong candidates, one a man, one a woman. The two were neck in neck in terms of qualifications. As we got close to decision time, my fellow hiring manager said off-handedly, that the woman just didn't seem ready enough. Hmm, I decided to get curious, as I like to call it. I asked for some objective facts about why she wasn't ready. Turns out, she was ready, but wasn't being given a fair opportunity because of her gender. Our group ended up revisiting and redefining the hiring criteria we developed, that way we could make a more objective choice. Because of my companies culture, I felt comfortable challenging that gender bias. Leaders can set the tone that it's safe to call it out when you see somebody not getting a fair shake. When they do, those leaders encourage courageous conversations and brave cultures. As a change agent, you too can build awareness. You can trigger a transformation. Let's reinvent how to make work work for women.



Overlooked opportunities for advocacy
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- If you think about it, you advocate for things all the time, but I guess you don't call it advocating. Maybe you call it managing the problem, handling an issue, or simply getting stuff done. You're making things happen, but are you seeing all the opportunities around you? To help you see more of these, I've developed a model I call S.P.A.R.K. Using S.P.A.R.K., you'll discover when you're advocating for yourself and see chances to do more of it. The S in S.P.A.R.K. is for start. Is there a project, a training, even a system that would help you be more effective in your role? These holes can be productive places to start asking for what you need. In one of my first jobs, I was a spokesperson for my company as we launched a new study. Reporters interviewed me, and I was excited by the responsibility, but being real, I was in over my head. I realized getting media training would be a good start. I proposed it to my company, and they approved, and guess what? I still use those media training tips today. The P is for pause. Is there a project or an initiative that you need to put on ice right now in order to do your best work? Maybe you're working on a marketing strategy that's simply not mission critical. Maybe you volunteered to help another department, but their demand has slowed down. This is a perfect place to negotiate to pause your work and come back to the project at a later time. The A is for adjust. Rarely will someone just hand you a tailor-made perfect opportunity, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't advocate to make some adjustments. If you're asked to sit on a committee, try adapting your team member role, let's say, to an advisor role. That way, you could meet with the committee less often. When someone hands you an unreasonable deadline, negotiate a new one. If something's less than optimal, fine tune it till it works for you. The R is for reclaim. Has anyone ever asked you to take on a task that actually became four tasks? When you face a creep and scope, where one thing was promised and another is given, advocate. If you've been working too many nights and weekends, brainstorm how you could reclaim your time, reducing your contribution in at least one place. Then propose that change with confidence. Reclaiming is all about limits and re-contracting with the other person. Lastly, the K is for kill off. What's an area you spend time on at work that you need to, well, break up with? Maybe you'd like to be taken off project useless town. You served on this project for two years and want to clear space for new accounts that excite you. Proposing you come off a dead-end project makes room for somebody else to be part of it. It also signals to others that you're strategic about your assignments and your time. Good things come to those who ask and ask ambitiously. It's time to spark a revolution in your career by asking for what you really need.




What's at stake when it comes to money
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Anytime we get up the nerve to advocate for ourselves, it's major. But there's one category of these conversations that holds a special kind of power, those times we ask for more money. When we negotiate starting salaries, raises or bonuses or don't, our basic means of financial support is on the line and it turns out so is our happiness. Did you know salary satisfaction is one of women's top three drivers for overall satisfaction at work? Let me explain. When we settle for a less than great salary, it may feel bad in the moment, but we likely hurt our everyday outlook and our morale over the long term too. Let's start by looking at two important forces that stunt women's ability to command top dollar pay. For one, data shows that women are often paid less relative to men for the exact same job, 20% less. That means getting paid fairly doesn't just happen on its own. With women more likely to be underpaid, it's all the more reason we need to feel confident initiating money-related conversations. This means seeing a job offer for example not as a proposal of job terms from your employer, but as an offer to negotiate. What lands in front of you the first time around is rarely a perfect snapshot of your value. Another key element here is that across studies, when women are seen as being particularly assertive like when asking for what they want, they can be seen as pushy or difficult. This assertiveness penalty creates a self-advocacy dilemma for plenty of women where you're cursed if you ask and you're cursed if you don't. Still, I hope this perception will motivate you to be a change maker, to continue to go after what you deserve, to change the way women asking is viewed. Now let's get geeky for a moment. It seems reasonable that when we negotiate starting salaries, raises and bonuses, it affects our bank account today, but what's easy to forget is that our choices also drive our future earnings. Take the example of a woman and a man, Maya and David, graduating with the same marketing degree from the same school starting work with the same employer. Maya accepts a salary of $50,000 while David accepts a starting rate of $55,000. The difference of $5,000 might not sound monumental, but when women are paid less in entry-level roles, it creates a domino effect that compounds into mid and late career. For Maya, David and many others, your current salary drives how much you're able to save for retirement, that number is further compounded when your employee matches your retirement savings. Your current salary also becomes a benchmark for what you can command in terms of your next role and salary. Can you start to see how your initial salary multiplies? How it creates a snowball effect? Here's the thing. You're going to have to live with the choices you make financially speaking. And what you get for settling for the minimum is just not enough. So be the chief negotiator of your own finances, of your dollar value. Normalize the act of negotiating. Your life choices and your well-being may just depend on it.



Developing a self-advocacy mindset
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Do you want to know what the best self-advocates do better than anyone else? Here's a twist. It's not a tactic. It's not a scripted phrase. It's not a maneuver. It's a mindset. People who get what they want and need view the world around them as highly negotiable. They see everyday circumstances as up for revision, as open to discussion. Nothing is written in cement. And this mindset, it's critical for you, too. Let's be real. Everyone has an approach to advocating for what they need, but we're doing it in different ways. Let's walk through the three most common approaches to self-advocacy that I see. As I do, I'll help you see what you're doing now so you can uncover the best approach. The first style is passivity. If you're someone with a passive style, you might take a wait and see kind of approach to getting your needs met. Rather than asking outright, you most likely delay stating your needs, let's say, for a raise, for fear you'll get rejected or rub somebody the wrong way. If you do ask for something, you might be quick to defer to the other person. Mind you, passive doesn't mean indifferent or a person who doesn't care. No, but what stops this kind of thinker from asking for what they want is the belief that your needs and wants are more important than mine. Another style is aggressiveness. Someone with an aggressive mindset might think of a deal they're negotiating with a vendor in terms of crushing their opponent, where there are only winners and losers. A person who asks for what they want in this way may be insistent, single-minded, even commanding. They'll repeat their points forcefully in declarations and sentences. The key belief driving the aggressive self-advocate is my needs are more important than yours. The third style is what I call the magic middle. It's not passive, and it's not aggressive. I call it healthy entitlement. People who have a healthy sense of entitlement don't see their own needs as selfish, needy, or weak. They accept they have a need, and then they get curious. Let's say they wanted to add another person to their understaffed team. They might ask questions about the circumstances or conditions needed to add that person. They might make a plea about how the understaffing is affecting the team's morale and productivity. They feel entitled to ask and go back and ask again. The belief powering this kind of self-advocate is your needs and wants are no more important than mine. Now, when I talk about developing a self-advocacy mindset, I'm talking about getting to that magic middle, to healthy entitlement, advocating for yourself because you see your needs as important, putting your fears into perspective. Give yourself permission to ask for what you need. That means not telling yourself no before they do.






Overcoming blockers to share your idea
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- When I was moving up as a management consultant, I knew it was time to ask for more money. I was trusted to lead some of our toughest client accounts, but I was underpaid. Focusing like a laser beam on a 10% raise, I made my ask. I got a no but I'll show you how to get a yes. Here's the secret, if you want to increase your chances of success, bring options to the table. Then, you don't gamble everything on one version of success, you create multiple version of success. First, ask yourself what's most important to you. At the top of a document or a piece of paper, list your overall position. What is it you want to improve? Why? For me, it was negotiating job terms that better reflected my value. Now, make two columns, the first is what you want, and the second is how that could look. For me, my first priority was money which could look like base pay or bonuses. But your first priority can be anything. List your priorities, identifying how each could look like I've done. Take your time here to really think through what you want. If you'd like to see mine more clearly, pause the video now and look over this image. Now rank your top three to four priorities by importance. This ranking shows you where you want to remain firm, and what means less to you. For me, it goes base pay, title change, time off, and the leadership conference. Pause this video again and go and rank your priorities. Okay, so using your priorities now, come up with three different combinations where each option looks different. We'll call these Options A, B, and C. These options are graduated from best to worst, each reflecting a mix of your top priorities. As you develop Option A, answer the question, what would be an epic outcome? Don't ask, what would just satisfy me? For me, the best outcome is a 10% raise, a title change and five days of paid time off or PTO. Now, come up with your Option B. Ask, what would be an excellent outcome? In my case, Option B includes a smaller bump up in pay and a lesser title change and one less day off. Then, with Option C ask, what would an extremely good outcome be? For me, Option C increases my pay and time off and it substitutes a title change with a conference. While I like Option A the best, I'd be happy with any of these scenarios. The idea here is to use your options during the negotiation as you face resistance. You only reach for Options B and C if you're getting no. Let's say I've asked for my Option A. I've done my homework, I've shown the evidence for what I'm asking for, I make it really shine. But despite all my good efforts, I get a hard no. Here's the ideal time to reach for Option B, a slightly less preferred option but still a good one. You might introduce Option B by saying, "I'm hearing you can't swing X, would you consider Y?" But what if once you've presented your Option B, you still hear a no? You propose Option C, ah-ha! Now we get our yes. Putting viable options forward helps you overcome what you don't know. The professional development budget may have more funds than the salary one, but we'll never know unless we ask. Go ahead and download the Exercise File if you haven't already. Start building your options so you're ready come negotiation time. Remember, it's easy to make smart decisions when there are no bad options.



Harnessing your network
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- We've all heard the conventional wisdom that who you know matters, but did you know tapping your network delivers big when asking for what you want? It doesn't matter if you're getting ready to advocate for a better performance review rating or an exciting new project. You improve your chances of getting what you're asking for when you consult the ultimate knowledge bank, other colleagues who've been there, done that, or no more than you about what you're asking for. So how can you start engaging your former and current colleagues to build a great case for what you need? I'll walk you through three advantages of tapping your network. With each benefit, I'll give you a critical question to ask your network so you're prepared next time you have an ask. The number one benefit of consulting your network is that you'll often get further validation to ask for what you want. When I was getting ready to ask for a flexible work arrangement several years ago, I gathered information from colleagues in similar companies. I not only discovered that my ask was in line with what similar companies were offering flexibility wise, I learned that I could aim even higher, and I did. To get this same gold mine of information, ask your network. Given what you know about XYZ, do you think my goal is low, just right, or high? Why? You can also get broad context on your counterpart's current situation. That's the person you're negotiating with. This is about understanding what struggles or goals are front and center for them. To gather this information on your counterpart, ask your mutual connection what do I to know about my counterpart's biggest pressure points or most pressing goals right now? Imagine you're proposing a bold new customer initiative to your company's senior vice president or SVP, someone you barely know. You turn to your internal and external networks and discovery through LinkedIn that a connection of yours recently worked for this executive. You learn the SVP's biggest passion is becoming more efficient. Now you can connect your pitch to his passion, framing your customer initiative as an accelerator, let's say, to becoming more efficient with client delivery. Your network can also help you process conversations and negotiations. This is especially important when you get a no or a maybe. Why? People who share their negotiations with others are likelier to go back a second time and ask again. To best tap your connections after a negotiation, share how it went. Then simply ask what are you hearing? What do you see as the smartest next move? When one woman pitched herself as the leader of a new product launch, she was disappointed and hurt when she was rejected. As she played the conversation back with a mentor at the company afterward, her mentor totally normalized the rejection, saying this happens all the time. Her mentor encouraged her to tweak her pitch and try again. As you make new proposals in your career, don't make the mistake of going it alone. Seek out external opinions. Refine your points and counterpoints. Play back your conversations. You may even notice you have a little more confidence and swagger.



Leveling the power dynamic
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- What picture comes to mind when you think about advocating your needs? In a famous study by Linda Babcock and her team at Carnegie Mellon, men said a ball game while women cited a root canal. Provocative, right? Whatever your go-to visual is for standing up for yourself, I can tell you it's driving the power balance in your conversations more than you think. A picture becomes our outlook and outlook steers our behavior. If we signal to our counterpart they have all the power, we cut our own argument short and we give in too easily. It can also feel bad to give away your power, kind of like a root canal. For most of us, advocating our needs with an authority figure is uniquely intimidating. If that sounds at all like you, it's okay. I'll show you how to break through three limiting mindsets with moves that balance the power dynamic in the room. That way, you can maintain your poise and your power. The first thing you might struggle with is hierarchy. This is where you emphasize your counterpart's higher position or clout and conclude you're less than. And let me tell you, it doesn't serve you. A better mindset is to focus on the fact that you're equals. Be respectful but firm, speak in a peer-to-peer style. Use communal terms like lets and why don't we rather than strictly I or you phrases. In doing this, you're setting a tone that you're collaborating, co-developing a solution to a problem. You have equal voices. This style shows confidence and it commands respect from the other side. The second mindset focuses on ability. Here there's a belief that they know more about this than me or they have all the answers and it can cause you to give up your power. You can overcome this by becoming the smartest in the room about whatever it is you're asking for. If you're pitching that the company should provide lactation rooms for new moms for example, you should become an unofficial expert on lactation rooms. Research competitors that have them and how they make them available. You instantly level the power with an authority figure when you're the most informed on the subject at hand. The third mindset focuses on appeasement. If your counterpart makes a decision you don't like, you have to go along with it, right? Wrong. If you get an unsatisfying answer, you can do more than just accept it. Directly challenge a no by expressing your displeasure as in, I'm really disappointed to hear you don't think I'm ready for more responsibility. Then, ask pointed questions about your counterpart's conclusion. When you do this, you're not accepting their answer outright. You're probing to understand their reasoning with questions like, can you share the rationale behind that decision? These tactics help you avoid totally yielding, maintaining your voice and your power. There's a great saying, if you put somebody up on a pedestal, don't be surprised if they start to look down on you. Before you can make a consistent impact with your ideas, you have to check your mindset. By making some simple mental shifts, you can change the tone of a conversation equalizing the power dynamic. Then you can stand up for what's rightfully yours.



Using key phrases to show your expertise
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Have you ever been excited to get a package only to have it arrive dinged and damaged? Disappointing, right? In a similar way, most people want to be heard. Yet too often, they fail to really get their ideas across. Not because their ideas stink, but because the package their ideas come in is flimsy. It's weak. As you advocate for better roles, opportunities and more, how can you make sure you're delivering your message with authority and confidence? In a moment, I'm going to show you two verbal tricks that convey just that. But first, I want you to do a fun exercise with me. It's called instant expert. I'm going to ask you some questions and I want you to answer each one aloud. Here's the catch. You need to answer with total authority and confidence. Remember, you're the world's leading expert. You can make things up. Nothing you say is wrong. Now I need you to imagine you're the world's foremost expert on puppies. Here's your first question. Why do people bond with puppies so easily? Good job. Now you're the world's foremost expert on pickles. Answer this question. How has the pickle evolved over time? If you did that, well done. If not, come on. Try it out on this last one. You're now the most prominent expert on ice carving. What was the very first ice carving of, and why? Nice work. So how did it feel? Liberating, I hope. When we give ourselves permission to speak with full authority, it's amazing what can happen. Now am I asking you to make things up everyday as you go? No, but I am asking you to speak with total authority and unshaking confidence about what you do know. Building on this, let's walk through two techniques that'll help you advocate your needs with power. First, amplify your voice. It's best to speak at a volume that can easily be heard. Let's test this. Say your name quietly at about a two out of 10 in volume. Like this, Selena. Now overdo it. Say your name at a 10 out of 10. Selena. Go ahead, do it. Too much, right? Now say it in the upper middle around a six or a seven. Selena. Try this one out. You've got this. That's the sweet spot we're going for, a volume that commands attention and says I'm here, but isn't over the top. Amplifying your volume will ensure your message is received. You can also elevate your I actions. When pitching your ideas, make sure that the words you use raise your stature, not undercut it. Stay away from I think, I believe, I suppose, I suggest, I guess, all of which lessen the strength of your message. Instead, phrase your ideas in succinct terms like I recommend, I propose, I expect, I question, I urge, I advise, these are strong actions we associate with leaders. Use them. As you fine tune your own personal speaking style, cut filler words such as like and sort of. You'll notice people will take you even more seriously. By speaking in clear audible tones and using confidence building terms, you'll start to see yourself as an authoritative expert and others will too.





Uncovering the issue behind the issue
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Don't ask, don't get. That's certainly true when it comes to advocating for what you need and deserve, but did you know that even when most people get up the nerve to negotiate their needs they fail to ask followup questions. As you become a fierce self-advocate, asking questions and then followup questions is one of your superpowers. This consultative approach unlocks key information, like the other person's constraints and the bigger picture surrounding your ask. That intel translates to an advantage. You can now learn the real issue behind an issue or come at the conversation from a new angle. So how can you empower yourself to get good at expensive questioning? Avoid dead-end questions. These are questions that can be answered with a simple yes or no, and they tend to invite curt surface-level responses. Some examples include so you think I'm not ready to handle the account? Do you feel better about my raise request today, and is there a rule in place that I can't change my title? Often asked in a reactionary way, these questions can force a yes or no answer or, worse, a defensive response. They can feel like an interrogation, and they usually polarize a negotiation. Now, let's flip our perspectives to deepening questions. These are the gold standard of communication, opening up dialogue, getting beneath the surface, and showing your interest in the other person's realities. Here are some examples. How could I help you feel more comfortable with this request? Would you be able to paint a picture of that for me? Can you explain how you arrived at that answer? What areas are most important to you? Can you explain why? When you're faced with anything but a yes answer, reach for deepening questions like these. They'll buy you time to think. If you want some more of my favorite go-to phrases, take a look at the exercise file. Remember, no ask, no get. Deeper questions will guide and move the conversation along, helping you reshape your message or change directions. They'll make a mutually beneficial result much more likely, and that right there is negotiation gold.



Interrupting interruptions
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Imagine summoning the courage to share a new idea with your team. Not just any idea, one you're really passionate about, one you've been researching for weeks. You share your idea and just when you get to the good part, you're cut off. The conversation gets derailed, people forget what you were saying. Infuriating, right? Now this might seem like a universal gripe, something all of us experience, but research shows women are 33% more likely than men to be interrupted. Being a fierce self advocate isn't just about asking for what you need. It's about being confident addressing everyday slights like interruptions, behavior that diminishes you and your contribution. So let's talk through five tactics you can use when you're interrupted or talked over. This way, you can maintain your voice in any conversation. First, get an ally. Partner with a teammate or manager to call out not okay behavior, like interruptions. Someone who's already motivated to foster an inclusive, collaborative culture. Build your ally's awareness by sharing your observations. This way, they can join in in challenging interrupters with you keep interrupting people, or the way you're speaking to people is making me uncomfortable. You can also amplify other women's messages by using these same ally behaviors, urging that the mic is passed around equitably. Second, confront it outside the group. For many of us, being criticized is hard enough, but it's even more upsetting if done publicly. If you want to explore the tension with an interrupter, particularly someone you suspect doesn't know they're doing it, take them aside privately. Simone, a woman I trained, was being chronically interrupted by her manager. She confronted him privately, got an apology, and the manager actually addressed his behavior with the entire team, apologizing for it. Third, you can call it out within the group. If interruptions are rampant, make a non-judgmental comment within your team. Keep it fact based, as in, "That's the third time Rosa got cut off", or "Everyone else weighed in, I'm not finished". In these cases, you're citing observable behavior, not using innuendo. This approach gives the interrupter a chance to correct what they're doing in case they're somehow not aware of their behavior. Fourth, and this one might feel a little bit or a lot uncomfortable. Carry right on talking. Now if you're watching this and you think I couldn't possibly, you're not alone. I used to feel that same way, but you can do this. After all, why isn't your perspective as important as anyone else's? Continuing to talk is particularly important with a serial repeat interrupter. This affirms your voice and your contribution, rather than stopping, yielding, and giving your attention to the intrusion. If you carry on talking and still feel invisible, don't fear. Talk louder. It'll help you regain your command of the room. And finally, use your body. The same tactic that works with my young twins when I'm on a call also works in business. Issue a physical signal to say I'm not finished. Try raising a hand or a finger to indicate wait as you carry right on talking. You can also big up your body when you're interrupted. If you're speaking seated, try standing up so you're more conspicuous. If it's important you sit, turn your torso to face each member of your audience. If you're holding anything in your hands like papers, spread them out in front of you to claim more space. Now here's the thing. This may seem overwhelming or like a bad idea to you, but I've seen it work. Using these tactics let you speak your peace and address interruptions. They also help you to take a stand and then move on. Don't we all want that?




Using humor to your advantage
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Ever been in a tense or droning meeting and felt instant relief when somebody told a joke? That's because humor disrupts the mood. It surprises us. And news flash, humor also helps you to be a fierce self-advocate. When you bring the funny to a negotiation, it puts others at ease. At the same time, it livens up the conversation. In fact, one study, published by the American Sociological Association, showed using humor improved outcomes by 18%. You might be thinking, Yeah, but I'm not a stand-up comic. Well, you don't need to be. In fact, telling even one clever or relevant joke is enough to help you advocate your way to better results. So don't shoot for flat out funny. Aim for making the conversation just a little bit funnier. Let's look at how you can use humor to improve your requests and relationships. First, have a joke or anecdote ready about something recent. Even your trip to the meeting. This tidbit gives you a funny answer to the opening question, How are you? Let's say you walk into your boss's office for a check-in. In the meeting, you plan to ask for more head count for your team but you know, before getting down to business, it'll help to laugh. When your boss says, How's it going? You could say, Living the dream, or, Making progress on world domination. Or maybe you had a funny misunderstanding this weekend with an Uber driver, a repair person, or a family member. Use recent events to kick things off. The second kind of humor you can use is observational. Is there something absurd or silly you can point out? One where nobody's the butt of the joke? Think of a common experience your counterpart or team can relate to. The freezing weather, the holiday that's approaching, even the tiny size of the room you're in. Let's say you're sitting with your team and you want to advocate for a different direction than they do on an issue. You notice the energy in the room is low, people are checking out. Rather than launching into why your perspective is right, you make a quip first. Adulting is tiring, huh? Or, Are we entering hibernation mode? Or, Is caffeine our only hope right now? This recaptures interest before you speak your mind. And finally, use funny metaphors and images. There are some visual terms that are funny simply because they paint an instant picture. Think having a brain freeze, losing something in the Bermuda Triangle, or hitting a pinata with a blindfold on. These images are unexpected comparisons at work which makes them fun and silly. Imagine you're negotiating with a peer to cover your projects while you're away. Just because you're talking business doesn't mean you can't use a funny metaphor. Try saying, Until they find a cure for FOMO, I'd appreciate it if you could send me a weekly update while I'm out. Sidebar: if you haven't heard of FOMO before, it's an American phrase meaning fear of missing out. I mean, really, doesn't everyone feel that way about work sometimes when they're on vacation? Experimenting with these humor boosters helps you to be hard on the issue at hand but soft on the person. Don't be afraid to be playful. You'll do more that just inject humor. You'll create a shared laugh that boosts rapport, eases tension, and motivates others to see things your way.



Intentionally using body language

- You may have heard of a poker face before. You know, the face that poker players use so no one can tell what they're thinking so they don't give away how good or bad their hand is. Well the same thing goes in high stakes negotiations when you want to advocate for yourself. You've got to learn how to essentially have a poker face and to control which physical tells or body cues you're giving off. Don't worry, you can do this in any situation. I'm going to walk you through how to identify and embody physical tells that strengthen your ask or idea. That reinforce your message, not weaken it. The first physical tell is the way you enter the room. As you enter that room your body's already doing the talking for you. Try to literally hold your head high, walking in long confident strides. Smile to set a tone of warmth. Let's say you're getting ready to propose a bold new product idea to your manager. What you don't want to say with your body is I'm sorry to take up your time today. Or you're doing me a favor. Instead enter with power. You're telling them you belong there. Here's another key tell, how you sit. Once you've entered the room and taken a seat sit in a way where you take up the entire chair. Where your back is firmly supported, your shoulders are back, and your legs are comfortably planted to the ground. Imagine you're asking a senior person that you want to be taken off of a dead end project. Sitting this way shows confidence in your ask and that you're committed to being there. It's the opposite of sitting on the edge of your seat which can make you look nervous or tentative. Maybe the most important tell of all is our eyes. Even if you're nervous which is normal you want to look continuously at that other person to have steady engaged eye contact. That tells them you're capable and you're present. I once proposed a shift to part time hours to my boss's boss. I'll never forget the challenge and yet the power of keeping friendly yet direct eye contact. It signals you're focused on the discussion and that you believe in what you're asking for. And it'll help you get a yes like I did. The last tell is the expressiveness of your face when you're hitting road blocks. When getting resistance we can all feel pressured to smile and say okay. Even when we disagree. A better way to maintain your authority is to have a neutral face when you get an answer you don't like. This is similar to a poker face where you temper or lessen outwardly what you're feeling inwardly. Here you maintain some power by creating some suspense where the other side isn't sure how you feel about a matter. This element of mystery can help prevent you from nodding in agreement to something you don't like. It prompts the other side to cooperate with you. Just like with poker negotiating your needs can come down to communicating smartly and leading with and revealing the right information. By using the power you already have in your body you'll support and back up your verbal message. And you'll get that much closer to a yes. You've got this.



Deploying strategic silence
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Silence, sometimes it says it all, but being quiet in a conversation when we're advocating for ourselves seems like the last thing we should do, right? Wrong. As counter as it seems, purposely creating pockets of silence in a high stakes conversation is a must. But first, let's get clear on what strategic silence isn't. Passively sitting there, or quietly watching, like an observer. I want you to see silence as one of your best sources of power, and then use it strategically. What do I mean? Quite simply I'm talking about periodically pausing leaving gaps in the conversation, and knowing which quiet instance count most. This way you can start to experiment in real life conversations with the power of these little pauses. Now, let's walk through two boom moments in a negotiation where you want to be sure to use silence. I call them boom moments because the way we react at these key points in the conversation matters, in a big way. Boom moments drive the outcomes of the conversation. They represent when it's particularly important to maintain our power. The first boom moment is right after you've made a request. Ask clearly, then create a pocket of seven seconds of silence. Let's say you've just requested a 15% raise. You'll sound most assured if you deliver that ask in a way that's clean and clear. That means you don't hesitate afterwards or begin adding words. That lessens your request. You also don't want to qualify your ask by saying something like, if you can afford it or I know it's been a hard year for the company. Instead, let your ask sink in and show you stand behind it. The second boom moment is right after you hear the other sides answers. Again, you give yourself seven seconds to be silent. Let's say you ask for your managers approval to lead a new internal committee. Her first response is that it'll be a lot of work, and that it could take away from your job. You listen to her reasoning, careful not to nod your head but keeping a neutral facial expression. This move will usually push your counterpart to give more reasons, sometimes even causing them to back out of their position and come up with a totally new response. It's hard to go wrong when you're silent. It can buy you more time to gather your thoughts. It can prevent you from agreeing to something you hate. And I promise, it doesn't look as strange to the other side as you might think. When you're silent you come across as engaged, like you're considering or deliberating on a point. What a great way to level the power.


Setting clear boundaries
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Sometimes when you say yes to someone, you end up saying no to yourself. I bet you can relate. So it's so important to set boundaries, essentially saying yes to what you want. It's one of the best ways to build your confidence and self-esteem. Let's take a look at some concrete ways you can skill up in setting clear limits. First off, you can't change what you don't label. So identify a boundary of yours that's either loose or nonexistent today so that you can set a clear boundary. It might be that you regularly leave work later than you plan to, so you're chronically late for school pickup. Maybe it's that you say yes to unreasonable deadlines whenever a certain person asks you. Maybe you regularly attend a meeting series where you're just not needed or adding value. Right now, grab a notepad, and jot down one boundary you can strengthen. Now add an action you'll put into place to honor that boundary. It might be take a 20-minute lunch break rather than working through lunch. Also, communicate your boundaries to your support network and your colleagues. You might contract verbally with your partner that you'll leave work five p.m. no matter what. You can tell your team you're opting out of certain meetings with the next department and that you appreciate them providing cover and backing your decision. Using your notepad, identify who you can share your boundary with in your personal or work network so you can strengthen it. Encourage this person to hold you accountable. Plus, be willing to say no when someone or something infringes on your boundary. Say you're feeling physically lousy, like you might come down with a cold. A request pops up for you to travel on a last-minute work trip. You entertain going, but your gut says don't. Honoring your boundary means sharing directly no, I can't. It doesn't mean saying I could, but I'd rather not. Remember, no can be a complete thought. You don't need to go into lengthy explanations. If you must, one simple clear reason supporting your no is often enough, and finally, mentally scan the environment where you work. While it's critical we set and communicate our boundaries, we also need to have our eyes open if there's a mismatch between us and our work environment. What does your work culture promote? What's the approach on your team to people's personal boundaries? If your boss is a workaholic, for example, or you're in a job or company that constantly violates the boundaries you communicate, it might be time to leave. While it's important to anticipate some compromise at times to your boundaries, it's not okay if there's constant disregard for them. If you're not being respected, learn to love the sound of your feet walking away from that place. Setting boundaries can feel nerve racking, awkward, even scary, but as someone who used to avoid it, I can tell you the good news is it gets easier with practice. Experiment with putting limits down. Make some mistakes as you go. Start where you are.



Derisking your ask
Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video
- Change. You might not be thinking about it when you're advocating for a new direction or idea but the truth is, any good self-advocate is proposing exactly that. A change to the way things are and yet, when faced with change, most people actively resist it. Knowing that, how do you get the other person to embrace your new idea or plan? You follow some proven strategies to de-risk your proposal. When you do this, you take what's new, weird or different and you make it feel familiar and manageable. That way you'll put the other person at ease and you'll up your chances of getting a yes answer. One way to de-risk your ask is to connect it to what's familiar. Highlight an existing practice and connect it to your request. This way, it feels like something your counterpart's used to. Maybe you're proposing a new job sharing agreement to your manager, one where you and a colleague will share a full-time role. While there's no one else in your own department that's job sharing, you find out there are four other people doing it successfully in another department. Then you share that information with your boss. Now the proposal feels less risky because it's already being done at your company. It's not something shockingly new. You can also show the cost of inaction to make your ask feel less risky. Here you describe the negative effects of doing nothing and that tends to create a sense of urgency in the other person, the sense that acting on your ask is safer than not acting. Say you're advocating for a junior team member's promotion. You've gathered performance data and team feedback and now you're ready to make your case. After you list the positives of promoting the junior team member, it's a good time to discuss what'll happen if you do nothing. You might say, "I'm worried what'll happen "to our team if we do nothing here. "Not only do I think our teammate might leave "if she doesn't get promoted "but it would be the fourth person to go in a year." Another de-risking technique is to use a cautionary tale. Here, you draw a comparison to something negative that's happened that's similar to your ask. Then you engage your listener by showing them how you're smarter and better equipped because of that failure. Let's say you're advocating for your company to develop a new product needed out in the market. A smart investment of your time would be to research companies that have launched similar products. Sure, you want to look for positive examples where products have succeeded but also important, failed products. This way you can explain how you'll learn from a poorly managed precedent, side stepping some of the trip wires and landmines other companies have faced. Using cautionary tales shows that you've studied the landscape and considered the issue from multiple angles. It shows you won't repeat mistakes. It instantly risk proofs what you're asking for. Now, one last way to de-risk your ask is to make it a trial. Rather than asking your manager to approve something new with a blanket yes, consider asking for a trial period. If you're proposing a new telecommuting arrangement, for example, you can ask your manager to commit to less by suggesting you try it out over three months. So each party has an out if the trial doesn't work. When you focus on what's exciting and novel about your idea alone, you're only seeing part of the picture. It's more effective to accept and anticipate your counterpart's resistance to your plans, even your best plans. Go ahead and download the exercise file to try out these strategies for yourself. This will give you a chance to de-risk your ask. Because remember, you show empathy for the other person's position and get that much closer to hearing yes.


Making all your strengths visible

- Can I share an eye opener with you? I've interviewed 50 plus of the highest ranking women leaders over the years. You know what they told me? They didn't become leaders by hammering themselves for their weaknesses. No, they figured out early on what their signature strengths were, then they cultivated them into superpowers. And I think the same is true for you. No matter what you advocate for in your career, your unique set of strengths is your superpower. So how can you get clear on your strengths? The first thing I want you to do is to start a success log. This is a document or notepad where you give yourself credit for putting your strengths into action. You add wins and compliments, you could also add efficiencies you've created, revenue you've brought in, or difficult projects you completed that made a difference. Write them all down. This document keeps you honest about your positive accomplishments. It also acts as a historical record of your value when you need to negotiate for better job terms. And guess what else? Reading it will make you feel awesome. Second, get clear on your strengths. Grab a piece of paper right now. Make three columns. In each column, write down a strength where you've gotten consistent recognition or praise. For example, maybe your client service is one of your strengths. Now underneath that strength, jot down the events for which you received this praise. You might notice they were all high pressure, high stakes interactions with VIP clients. In my own career, I worked in a team leader role where I was really able to flex my idea muscles. I became known as being a strong idea person and I got recognition for it. But something else was happening. During a major, stressful company realignment, I maintained zero turnover on my team over a nine month period. The work I was doing was in change management, not idea generation and it wasn't being noticed. This was my non-event. I began adding change management activities to my success log and speaking about them in my performance check-ins. Ultimately, I was able to use that track record to negotiate for a role with a bigger change management component. The same is true for you. I can guarantee that you have some kind of value that's going unseen or unnoticed. Your non-event is often a ripe, productive place to begin advocating for yourself. Be it for resources, opportunities, visibility, or formal acknowledgement of your work. Commit to scanning your environment for your strengths in action. After all, your contributions come from the unique properties you bring to your workplace. Be the world's best expert on what they are.



Moving forward as a self-advocate

- Being a vocal self advocate is the ultimate tool for being heard, getting what you need and sparking change. If you've been toying with the idea of taking a chance or going for an opportunity, do it. Your growth, regardless of the result, will make it worth it. When you commit to being a self advocate, you take control of your future. You create a life free of resentments, and trampled boundaries. And you don't just hope for things, you speak them into being. This life skill will grant more of your aspirations than you can dream up. All right self advocates, it's time to put these skills into practice, to experiment. As you do, make sure you bring a learning mindset. Get in the habit of giving yourself credit, and praise for your effort, not just your results. Check out my book, "Pushback" for more ideas on advocating with ease, and reach out and connect with me on LinkedIn, and at my website, selenarezvani.com. Here's a final question for you. Have you ever had the realization that very little happens just naturally on its own? Good things just don't come to those who wait. They come to those who ask, and advocate. Do that, then look around and mentor someone else to do the same. Don't just advocate to own your career, advocate to own your life. Now's the time to go for it.
