DESCRIPTION:Instructions:\n\nView the entire assignment by clicking on it. 
	This text field does not show any attached files.\nUpload the assignment in
	 a formatted PC compatible word document and place in the relevant Brightsp
	ace Assignment folder. \n\nDescription: \nThe entire class will watch the s
	ame video. It is on the complete skill of Requirements Gathering—now known 
	more accurately as Requirements Elicitation and Analysis.  With that founda
	tion in place\, we will focus most specifically on asking good questions (a
	ka in the video as Interviewing).\n \nAnswer the following questions. We wi
	ll discuss them in class during session 4.\n \nPart 1: From watching the vi
	deo:\nWhat part of the video was the most useful or interesting to you?  Wh
	y? \n \n \nPart 2: Scenario Questions\nFor the next sections\, consider the
	 following Scenario: \nYou have been assigned to a new project and met with
	 the IT leader responsible for the effort. Here are some of the things the 
	IT leader has shared with you about the project:\n\nThe project is to repla
	ce a legacy system with a package software.\nThe package software is for a 
	CRM (customer relationship management) system.\nThe business sponsor is pre
	tty sure about which package he wants implemented.\nThe user groups have a 
	lot of ideas and concerns: ideas about what they would like and do not have
	 and concerns about losing what they do have.\n\nThe IT leader would like y
	ou to get to work on requirements.  What questions should you ask?  Come up
	 with at least 3 specific questions for each type of interview question for
	 the Scenario.\n\nEngaging: Ex. What does success look like for this projec
	t?\nProbing:  Ex. Tell me more about…\nDomain-specific: Ex. In what ways do
	es the current process work well?\nUser and Subject Matter Expert: Ex. What
	 are your major responsibilities?\nProcess and detail: Ex. What is a typica
	l scenario for this process?\n\n \n \n \nPart 3: Mapping out progressive qu
	estions\n \nYour non-technical co-worker needs your help.  Their applicatio
	ns won’t work on their PC. What progressive questions should you ask? Creat
	e a flow chart diagram that asks at least 6 probing and/or progressive ques
	tions. \n\n\nAssignments:\nPPIT Ass 2 - https://nscconline.brightspace.com/

SUMMARY:PPIT Task D - Due
LOCATION:COMM1700/4157/Professional Practices for IT I(B)/Scarfone\,Marc
DESCRIPTION:Instructions:\n\nView the entire assignment by clicking on it. 
	This text field does not show any attached files.\nUpload the assignment in
	 a formatted PC compatible word document and place in the relevant Brightsp
	ace Assignment folder. \n\nDescription:  Do some work to make your resume b
	etter.\nTask D Instructions\nTime is set up in class for you to work on Tas
	k. You don't need to work on this ahead of time.\nThis is a huge topic.  Ov
	er the years I've noticed that approximately half of any class group is not
	 fully ready to work on this. Because of that you get to choose ONE (1) the
	se things to be your task.  I have prioritized these tasks. In other words\
	, make sure you can do #1 before you consider doing #2.  \nWork on it for a
	bout 30 minutes and then put your work in the Brightspace Assignment Folder
	.  Do not compress the file. (Please note\, with the exception of option 1\
	, most of this work can take many hours to produce. The point is simply to 
	get you started.)\nYou will take a moment to consider which Task you choose
	. \n\nIf you have never made a proper skill statement.\n\nObserve the follo
	wing video and then make a description of the skill displayed.  \nhttps://y
	outu.be/FGB4eDT6TrE   (Real Egg Crackdown  | McDonalds ) \nMake an impact s
	tatement based on what you saw in the video.   Use the Describe- Skill- Ach
	ievement format. Be prepared to discuss\nUltimately you want statements lik
	e this for professional experience\, education and volunteer experience (ie
	. Everything)\n\n\nIf you have never made a resume before: \n\nMake a basic
	 resume by grabbing a template from this link and fill in the basic informa
	tion.  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-resume-in-2017
	-b8ea9dfdd3b9/\n\n\nAdd employability skills to your basic resume\n\nRefere
	nce the conference board of Canada skills   https://www.conferenceboard.ca/
	docs/default-source/educ-public/esp2000.pdf?sfvrsn=dd440e69_0\nTry to place
	 ALL conference board of Canada skills SOMEWHERE on your resume.  (ie. spre
	ad them out)\nIt is best to have a SPECIFIC Job Posting in mind.  That way 
	you can concretely put relevant information on your resume. \n\n\nAdd IT sk
	ills to your basic resume.\n\nTake your basic resume and add the IT skills 
	you will get from Year 1 of the NSCC Information Technology Program  (Fall 
	and Winter semesters) so that you can be ready to apply for Spring Work ter
	ms.\nuse this link to grab only the year 1 courses (ie. the 1000 and 2000 c
	oded courses)  https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/programs-by-a
	rea-of-interest/it-data-analytics.asp\n\n\nAdd achievements to your basic r
	esume\n\nEvery single professional experience\, education and volunteer ent
	ry should have a skill/achievement statement  (most people don't take the t
	ime to do this)\nPRO TIP:  This is why you make portfolio worksamples.  The
	 end product is a RESULT.\n\n\nCustomize your IT resume in preparation for 
	an IT work term \n\nYou have curated all of your descriptions (education\, 
	work\, volunteer) so that each one is highlighting one of the requirement i
	n a job posting.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments:\nPPIT Task D - https://nscconline.

	n\nIf you are able\, think of at least 2 or 3 moments\, then take some time
	 describe and then analyze those moments. Are there any similarities or pat
	terns to those moments?\, or\nIf you are not able to think of some moments\
	, then take a personality test listed in the Helpful Resources section belo
	w.\n\n\nRegardless of the method used\, answer the following questions: \n\
	nWhat new strengths emerged from the exercise?\nHow would you describe that
	 strength\, using examples?\nHow might you use those strengths going forwar
	d for work or school? \nHow might you change the way you do things today\, 
	now that you recognize this strength?\n\n\nPrepare a professionally formatt
	ed document to describe the above and place in the Brightspace Assignment f
	older. \n\n\nHelpful resources to better define and understand your strengt

	strengths-themes.aspx\n\n\nInstructor Example:  Synergy is one of my streng
	ths\nI am strong at synergy.  Synergy means to combine things together to b
	e more effective.    Throughout my career I have been able to clearly see t
	he root of the problem\, negotiate a simple\, practical solution with stake
	holders and get all parties to transition to a new\, more efficient way of 
	doing things.   I like the mental challenge of taking something that exists
	 and making it better. I am empowered by coming up with the solution\, whic
	h I can see as clearly as as the light of day.  It enables me to establish 
	a Vision  of a better future which propels me to action and enables me to m
	otivate others to help make that vision become a reality.  Because of this 
	I am very effective at leading change (ie. Change Management).\n\nIn 1998\,
	 I created an marketing work order system that systemized the processes bet
	ween marketing officers\, graphics designers\, printshop and the client.\nI
	n 2000\, I established a program approach to communicating municipal solid 
	waste services to the public. This more closely tied actions to goals and t
	arget audiences.\nIn 2001\, I transitioned a solid waste newspaper to a bro
	ader environmental sustainability newspaper. The contributing authors went 
	from 1 department to 7 departments and required much tighter and nimble coo
	rdination and integration of messaging.\nIn 2002\, I co-chaired a performan
	ce measurement workgroup which established performance measures for the Hal
	ifax city government. This required all municipal departments to work toget
	her in order to demonstrate connection to strategic goals.\nIn 2002\, I led
	 the transformation of paper-based processes to the use of an ERP system fo
	r corporate call centre service requests which improved delivery of municip
	al services to the public.\nIn 2007\, as corporate business planning coordi
	nator I clarified processes\, simplified work and made it more closely alig
	ned to goals.  This made the work more simplified\, but also more results f
	ocused.\nIn 2011\, as a transit manager I transitioned spreadsheet based pr
	ocesses to an ERP system enabling better decision-making and better deploym
	ent of operational resources.\nIn 2014\, as a faculty member I developed a 
	student work term development program that integrated a series of events an
	d milestones to support student work terms (this led to eventual developmen
	t of the IT Job Fair).\nIn 2017 I founded project Blackbird to develop inno
	vative educational products to support the NSCC learning environment. Over 
	time more projects have been developed and more faculty have become involve
	d in the initiative.\n\n\n\nAssignments:\nPPIT Task C - https://nscconline.

SUMMARY:PPIT Project - Due
LOCATION:COMM2700/3796/Professional Practices for IT II(B)/Scarfone\,Marc
DESCRIPTION:Due Date:\nThe Brightspace due date is for the written report. 
	You still need to present your work on your assigned class day\, which may 
	be earlier than the Brightspace due date. \n\nInstructions\n\n\nWork on a p
	roject developing a non-technical (employability) skill.   Spend 15 minutes
	 per day\, 5 days a week for 6 weeks (450 minutes/7.5 hours total) developi
	ng a non-technical skill.  Your time spent includes establishing a baseline
	 of your skill level\, measuring your skill level progression\, watching vi
	deos\, reading\, documenting and practicing the skill. You may refer to the
	 PPIT Map\, a document\, which outlines various topics for topic ideas. \n\
	nDocument your activity\, write a report and present it near the end of the
	 semester.\n\nFavourite topics include: healthy habits (eating\, sleep\, ex
	ercise\, mindfulness)\, physical exercise\, developing your English as an A
	lternate Language skills.  \n\n\nIn COMM 1700: personal success\, time mana
	gement\, personal organization\, typing\, speed reading\, study skills\, no
	te taking\, learning how to use an Office 365 product\, learning how to use
	 GitHub.  \n\n\nIn COMM 2700: emotional intelligence\, personality\, confli
	ct management\, building relationships\, etc.  You may also develop your En
	glish Language skills.  You may also continue the project you did in COMM 1
	700\, however you must develop goals to advance your skill progression.\n\n
	\nPlease note: This is NOT a research report. You are expected to put theor
	y into practice and demonstrate that you have developed skills. It is a goo
	d idea to take a baseline measure of you knowledge of the skill and then to
	 keep a record as you develop the skill.  RESULTS are important.\n\n\n\n\nA
