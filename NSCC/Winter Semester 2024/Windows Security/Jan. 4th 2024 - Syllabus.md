|**TENTATIVE SCHEDULE**|
|Because every learner is different, it is effective to align the pace, workload, and delivery strategy to strengths of the learners. In a creative learning environment, **y****ou should expect some variations** from this tentative work plan as well as a variety of informal assessments throughout the course.|

### Need : 


#### Windows Server 2019 Standard -- Get it from Azure. 


If we are using our own laptop, we will need the key that it will come with it. We previously referenced the KMS key. Use the KMS key that we talked about before. Our virtual machine needs to be on the college network. We would need to connect the drive to the computer/plug the LAN cable into the laptop, activate it with the KMS key. The key will last all semester. The server HAS to be activated. 



Windows 10 22H2 - standard - with the KMS key 


#### VMWare 17.0.0 


We can use VMWare 17.0.2, but we CANNOT use 17.0.5. 17.0.0 is the version number in the lab. This is the lowest stable version before 17.0.5. 17.0.5 marked a major change in hardware requirements. 



We are working in a 2-VM environment. If we are running a laptop with 16GB of RAM, we are working in an environment that would need room to run two virtual machines and the host machine 


8 GB for the VM, 4GB for the other VM, and 4GB for the host OS. 


192.168.208.0 ---- Class-C private addressing --> used by VMWare . It randomly assigns the 3rd Octet. On campus, this is not an issue. They have set the IP addressing over the break for all the machines. Marie will keep referring to the IP information. Everything we do is involving : 


192.168.something.0/24

At home, change the third octet to 208. Make sure know where to get the KMS key from.
