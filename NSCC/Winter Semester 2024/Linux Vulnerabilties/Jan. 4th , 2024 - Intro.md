He would like to start the course by building on information from the previous term. 



Ron would like to do a couple of classes on **TCP Handshakes** and other basics, as vulnerabilities atre based on that. We will start with **DNS**. He can not give DNS assignments anymore. *DNS Poisoning* is a simple hack. There are thousands of servers out there that DNS Poisoning works on. Nowadays, it is difficult to find a target that is vulernable to DNS Poisoning. He will discuss the vulnerabilities with us. We will do **Man-In-The-Middle Attacks**... We will cover *Sans-Malware Attack*. 



Get **Metasploit**! 


## Tools of the Trade 

There are two tools used : 


1. Metasploit : 

	An attacker's toolkit

2. Security Onion :

	A Defence toolkit



We will look at *Software Vulnerabilities* , etc ...


He will focus on the vulnerability itself rather than the tool. 

Example :

SMB1 is vulnerable with *EternalBlue*...


If you have a vulnerability baked-in the OS itself... SMB is part of Windows and the Networking Platform of Windows. It is a feature! which makes it even more vulnerable. Between now and next week : 


1. Make sure we have *Metasploit* ( DO NOT install it on Ubuntu. Just get Kali!)
2.  Get started on *Bandit* ! Complete up to **Level 15** ! **OVER THE WIRE**



2-3 weeks for assignments
