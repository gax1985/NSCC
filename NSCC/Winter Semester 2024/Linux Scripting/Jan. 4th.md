We will do a **Bandit** exercise, which is akin to an online game. We will have objectives at each level, which will take Linux Scripting commands. We will go into the deep end. At each level, we will have a bunch of Linux commands that we may or may not use. What Ron wants us to do is to a keep a **diary**; at each level, we have to do a detailed explanation of each command. If we have a commabnd that has parame8ters, we would have to explain the command and the parameters. Most of the commands can be described ina  couple of lines. At the next level, some of the commands can be repeated. Each level does not mean that the commands will be used there only. 

Create a MySQL Database which would be a repository for **Linux commands**




We learned network scannning with **Nessus** last semestar. This time, we will learn how to do scans without tools in the *Vulnerabilities* class. The course's *Bandit Assignment* will be worth 10%. After we get the first couple of lectures, we will have a week to a week and  a half of us working on it in class. 



Then, we will have a *Basic Scripting Project*, *Advanced Scripting Project*, and then decide on the *Term Project* ; we have to do complex manipulations of the Linux operating system. 


In the **Exploits Class**, we will handle *Windows Vulnerabilities* ; which will include **Active Directory**



Hint : We can choose *VirtualBox* instead of *VMWare*. 


Advice: Take snapshots, clone the virtual machines!




## Project Ideas 



We start with *Files in a Directory*...


The *Files* ha ve t o be backed up : **Create a Backup**. Consider what you have to do. You have to record when it was backed up etc. Then *Hash the files*, *encrypt them*, come up with a *Recovery Option*, check if the file in the directory which should NOT be changed has changed by *Re-Hashing*, then do a *comparison*. If the file that should not have changed has in fact changed, then you plan a sequence of events for that eventuality. There is a lot in that simple project. There is *Encryption*, *File Monitoring*, *Backup options*, *Recovery options*. It has to be a **Systems' Management Project**. It has to do with a *matching Linux environment*


Look up : 


nptstat
nptscan
netbios (in general. How you can use the netbios tools like nptstat,nptscan to enhance the security on the operating system. Do we have shares that we should not have? We can use these things to do enumeration. In the past, we used *nmap* , *nessus*, which are third-party tools. How can we use the basic tools of the operating system to do exactly what they do. We can take all the system files for an Linux distro, hash them, compare the hashes with the old hashes, check if the OS changed , if it did, why? you find the malware, take it off, and then recover the original system )



Start thinking of systems' management, scripting and security in Linux. The first couple of weeks will involve learning Linux commands. We can have the Linux VM that we will be working with.

There is another approach (which he does not recommend) : up to two laptops ago for Ron, he had the laptops configured for dual boot, where we can choose Linux or Windows. Windows and Mac PCs are victims. Linux is the attack OS.

>Mice are not allowed!


Ron will be posting the first assignment by Monday. The solution to every level of the *Bandit* game is available online! You can solve it in a couple of hours! This way , you will have a good grade with some learning....



The other approach is better : 


Any assignment that was assigned before the official drop date of the couse has to be completed **Before that date of March 5th!**



If we do not learn it, we will suffer on the long term. If we are stuck on the Bandit level, look up the solution. If we do not complete the required assignments before that date, Ron will ask us to drop the course. 


>[!warning]
>Ron needs the project idea by **Early February!**

Look up *Linux Management Script Project*



If we look up the answers of the Bandit level, make sure that you acquire some learning by looking up the answer. Analyze the answer and see why it worked, and do so for each level. 


Ron will put up links on the course's shell. 



Ron mentioned that exploits gets overcome frequently. We have exploits that do not involve malware. Why ? we are getting good at detecting malware. The attackers have shifted towards using real-account privileges : discovering usernames/passwords to get in, and then afterwards, they can work with malware. Malware is less about getting-in now. We have an increase in techniques to discover credentials. Ron mentioned that MGM Grand got hacked , and he was emailed about it. It was done with *Social Engineering*. Someone called an IT person and asked them for the password. 



In Physical Security, the most common way to get in is *Unlocked Doors!*


In digital equivalent is **Pass-The-Hash**


There are metadata about users in the *Azure Cloud*


When we manage a team, after a holiday break, it is always a good idea to have a couple of days that do not involve work! This is to transition smoothly from no-school to school. 



As we are learning new things, we need to apply everything we have learned towards personal projects! The information has to stay fresh in our minds!


## Work terms :


It is OUR responsibility to find Work Terms. They are *five-weeks* in **May**!


There are a couple of other options : 


1. We find a company that would take us in for five weeks : gives you an opportunity to try soft-skills. They evaluate you, and sometimes they get employment offers from that work term (best possible solution!). A lot of companies do not bother because they train someone and then they leave after 5-weeks. It is your time to shine there! 
2. There is an Entrepreneurial course available!  It runs in May-June! If you are thinking about starting a business, which Ron STRONGLY encourages, we should do so. Register a company, print business cards, and then when we would do freelance work, we would be ready to do. Ron personally mentored many IT startups. 
3. In-House Projects: Ron always have projects they are working on in the spring, attach yourself to a instructor's project for five-weeks.  There are projects happening right now, or start one yourself :D Examples : a Linux Systems Management Software that we can make some progress on in the project, set up a website, start a Git repo, and then this would be a great thing to do! One of the challenges in Cybersecurity is teaching! The North-Korea model is all about pushing back. If the instructor had a box which contains a system for projects with a lesson plan. NSCC tried that, and this fell apart. The audience is there. You can do advanced work and Ron could use it to help the other students. Example : a Packet Simulator!



As we go forward wit the material, keep that in mind! 






NSE gets daily reports about vulnerabilties. Software is automatically shipped to a server does its thing, gets shipped to the other server, does its thing, and so on. Everything is automated!


REGEX is used to obfuscate things. Sometimes you have to rely on behavior signatures. 


**Indicators of Compromise**: Changes to the Operating System. 


What could happen to a user account which can be used as an *Indicator of Compromise* ? 


1. Sudden Higher Privilege
2. Active account when it should not be active
3. Hash mismatch
and so on ...


Alot of the security software works like this


**MITRE** is most helpful! Vulnerabilities listed there. 


Monitor changes, make a script that does that to detect **Indicators of Compromise**. 


a 90 hour course : Ron would take a class and make it a lab-class. Ron would like to make sure that we have time on our schedules to learn. 




Lecture ---> intro --> examples --> assignment --> time in the class to do the assignment.





THURSDAY AFTERNOON --> LAB CLASS!



#### Maintain the Commitment to the Work!



On Tursday : 


Where teh script is located
What is a she=bang
looping
variable definitions in scripts
I/O , files etc.... 






Have the Ubuntu VM ready!


NOC , SOC (Look them up!)
