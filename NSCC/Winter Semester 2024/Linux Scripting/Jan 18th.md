# The *read* commnand ( in Linux) 









## The *sleep* Statement 



If we have the following command : 


		echo "I have no idea"; 


... and we would like to slow the outputs for the user, we do the following : 



		echo "I have no idea"; sleep 5;; 




Add a While Loop , read statement , user enters the statement, quit



The challenges are meant to give us an opportunity to explore. If you are requrewd to program a scripting game, you would want to make it look cool. 


Look up : 



WAIT statement

LOOP Statement

CASE statement 

SLEEP Statement
