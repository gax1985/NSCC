After this discussion, we will have the new **Assignment 2**, which will introduce us to the concepts of using Linux scripting for Systems' Management



Ron would like to start having people propose our projects to him. We need to get started on them. If your idea is rejected, do not take it personally. He would suggest changes to make it fit the goal. 






# Presentation by the Leaders of Cyber Defence in the US made to the **Congress**



This Chinese attack happened in the past *24-hours*. It is quite serious and realistic 



We will talk afterwards about how we see the world and how to adjjust our behaviiour to deal with how the world is. 




The video's link will be up on **BrightSpace**



Each witness, chair and Members of the committee will make statements. This committee is set up to gauge the US' war footing to see how well the US is doing cyber-wise. 



Harry Cocrum Jr. is responsible for the office of Cyunber defence from a policy standpoint. His position was recreated a month ago, because it was always in the Security Council, whose member resided in the White House. They had to communicate with their adversaries Cyber-wise ( on proper things to say and do). 



In 2016, Trump closed the office as a response to their investigations into Russian interference in the US elections of 2016. 



Christopher Ray isi the directror if the FBI


Jen Easterley ( follow her) is the director of CISA ( Monitor against Cyber threats against civilian/government infrastructure)


Gn. MacSonny , directpr of the NSA ( Until Feb. 1st). Responsible for Offensive/Defensive Aspects of the military in Cyber warfare



They all **took part in defeating a Chinese attack**. This response changes how the Chinese conduct offensive Cyber operations. 



War in general affects civilians and civilians infrastructure. No one is the good guys. We are just the other guys. You can choose to dislike what the government military etc and voice your opposition. Fundamentally, we have a role to play in defensive/offensive capabilities. You can choose not to be a part of this. We are not allowed to enhance/support the other side.  You can disagree but you are a member. 


War is a difficult topic. This is why we avoid it. They say we do not attack civilian infrastructure. We intentionally have massive causalities for innocent civilians. The Canadian military intentionally bombed civilians in Dresdenn in WWII. Part of being on this side is accepting that this happens. You have to understand why we avoid war. 


Russians increased their cyber operations due to Canada's support for Ukraine. The Chinese government's attacks in the past 6 months are different. In 2027 , they want objectives accomplished, and one of their goals is modernizing their military, such as making replicas of jet fighters , aircraft carriers, but most importantly their *Cyber Military*. In 2027, they aim to re-assimilate Taiwan. They are laying the ground work for this conflict. They are taking actions today to prepare, and one of them is this latest attack discussed in the testimony.

### The Video's Notes : 



 They are wondering if they are moving against Taiwan, and this is a debatan;e question. Thie invasion would be cosrly . The intelligfence portion of the battle space was spenmt in the previous time in cyber space , with a focus on thefts to drive military modernization, gathering senstive information on American citizens (OPN's military records leaked), they stole more personal data than any nation combined. The CCP has hacked into US infrastructure to destroy the US infrastructure if a conflict issues regarding to Taiwan. 

The purpose: Be ready to destroy US Infrastructure. This is a huge threat. It is not hypothetical, as the witnesses will deliver their testimonies in the video. The damage is difficult to imagine. There is a need for defense, and it will take collaboration between public and the priovate sector.  

It is strategic threat in the heart of the US. CCP can turn off lights in US cities. They call on both parties to collaborate on defense against this threat. 


Ugla Gorilla / Candy Group : The wanted poster shows 61398's group for hacking into US companies and 1st time thei endited Chinese nationals for cyber offenses. They are trying to dominate the cyber world by hacking into citizens' data, government data, and tiktok. CISA , FBI Five Eyes and others issues a notice that the PRC is attacking infrastructrure in "BOLT TYPOHHOON " which started in 2021. They targrted hawaii GUamm and the Texas electric grid. The pirpiose was to install malware, which would be distrupt/damage infrastruture to harm the US at the time of a strategist. They are discussing coordinated cyber attacks with missle launches. This is done to cause societal choas, lluike large scale blackouts in major cities, internet , phone mobvile service. etc. ... 


The Objective : it is not just to target military , but also to "Shake the enemy's will to wage war"
Hunt Malware! Reuters reported the Justice Deptt. and the FBI were asking to disable malware on affected devices. 
Deter the adversary : Malicious chinese code did not yet affect the netwokr. The uS has the inherit right to self defense. So, there is a need to bve able to respond adequately and strongly. 


#### Ray's Testimony :


The CCP is the defining threat of this generation. 



There has been little public focus on Chinese hackers targeting water treatment, electrical oil , transportation. The risk is immense, which demands action now. 

They are not just focused on military, but targeting civilians as well . Low-Blows against civilians are a poart of the CCP's plan. 


They are attacking US economic security, theft of technological secrets, and the threat is made more dangerous when incorporating insiders, human intelligence with Cyber offensive operations. 


They target US freedoms to silence coerce, threaten US citizens. 


The US is working in partnershup with the private sector, all levels of US govewrtnm,ent, US partners around the world. This morning, they announced an operation which identified hundreds of routers taken over by the VOLT TYPHOON group. 

PRC researched ways to cripple the US infrastructure, which represent real-world threat to US physical security. They shut down VOLT Typhoon and the access they enabled. To quantify, the PRC has a bigger hacking program than any major nations combined. 


China's hackers would outnumber cyber personnel 50-to-1


in 2027, the CCP has chosen this year as their target year to take Taiwan. The goal behind his testimony is trhat they coujld not afford to sleep on this threat, and there is a need to make sure the defences will overcome the threat.



#### Gallagher's Testimony : 


He led OMCD., which was estyablished by congress to provide advising to the US government. They have budgetory responsibilities to make sure of fiunancial readiness for cyber policies. Coordination and collaboration are essential to their operations. The hearing is aimed to let the american public know of the threat. The PRC's Volt Typhoon has conducted cyber operations on deploying DEEP ACCESS into Critical Infrastructure to disrupt US military's ability to mobilize, and to hinder US's progress in protecting and defending the US citizens. 


The National Cyber Security STrategy is threat agnostic, and strategy agnostic. They favor inceinstives for long term investments. 


He mentioned that future systems should be inherintly secure. The first pillar : defend critical infrastructure! The owners and operators are mostly in the ppublic/private sector collaborations. They need to establish cyber security reqwuirements that are adequjate. They aim to change dynamics to favor defenders. They are working to elevate proper coding practices. 

They are looking to expand opportunities for all to learn cybersecurity. 

Cyber security requires a unity of effort, with no one being able to achieve this goal alone



#### Easterly's Speech : 



They saw a concerningh evolution of PRC's targeting of critical infrastructure. VOlt Typhoon got in deeply into the infrastructure. The Taiwan's potential conflict could directly affect US lives at home, and the PRC's aim is to create choas, and lessen the military's readiness. 


The PRC targeted aviation , water , energy , trabnsportation etc,.. 



They are working aggressively with their partners in the industry to tackle this threat. 



They are trying to uncover additional Chiense cyber offensive operations. They are working on detecting and preventing Chinese attacks, and they haave individuals working with businesses in the private sector to bolster their defenses . 



The chinese cyber threat actors have taken advantange of basic flaws in the technology. It was inheritly insecure due to software develiopers rushed their work to bolster sales, and trhgere was a lack of accountability .  Every victim of a cyber incident should report the attacks immediately, and the US govenment is doing free vulnerability scans, and they are recommending to do the necessary investment in cyber hygiene, and to protect their own supply chains. Businesses should prepare for an attack , and test their critical systems to continue to operate during disruptions, and every tech manufactuerer should deploy technology that is *Secure By Design*. 


Every CEO business leader, board member recognize that cyber risk is business risk. 



#### Nakasone's Speech : 



Rep. of NSA and Military. 


PRC pose a challenge that is entirely new and competing fiercly in the cyber domain. Defence is the top priority. 



The trick is to make it costly to attack , and to lessen all the potential gains that the attackers would get, frustrate their efforts. 


Relations with the private sector helps in defending against this threat, and this is demonstarted in May 2023 which reported for the 1st time on Volt Typhoon. 





#### Question for Easterly : 


q) china's strategy is to hold the uS hostage? or cause casualties on the US land ? 
A) chinese military doctrine to induce societal panic in their adversary. Collonial pipeline's attack which hsut down oil for trhe eastern US caused a huge panic. This on many pipeliness , disturbing cellphones, water pollution,  and all this could happen at once. This is aimed to lessen the US' ability to defend Taiwan. 


q) an attack on GUam , what impact could it have? 
a) It would affect communications to distrub trhe launch of US' weapons. 


#### QUestion for Wray : 


They wokr with cyber criminals which is an addition to their official cyber groups. China takes a huge chunk on the US' investment in cyber defense. The threat pervades all US programs. 


Tiktok : The risk is the role of the chinese government. The app's creator is a puppet of the chinese government. It would enable then to leverage the data on millions of users, which can be used for ilntelligence . The tiktok algorith, is hard to detect, and they would use that algorithm for influence operations. AI makes it much more devastating. They could compromise mobile devices with the TikTok app. 



#### Question for Nakasone : 


Russians cut off internet access for millions of Ukrainians in one cyber attack. and cut off electricity for many Ukrainians in another attack. 

CCP's attacks : The malware has not been activated yet. If the malware is activated, would you be able to pinpoint its origins ? Yes


Aspen security forum : " "f a nation-state decided to hit critical infrastructure, it would be above the threshold of war"  this was said by the witness few years ago. 

Can Cybercon defined effectively? yes, but there should be collaboration between partners.  


Tiktok is unqiue in the way it is created and  owned by company owned by the CCP. CCP demonstrated their contempt for US laws. ''


How can you prevent Chinese election meddling ? There is a lot of work across agencies and US partnetrs to try to anticipate and prevent any efforts to impact US elections. the public has a hyge role to play in defence!


>[!todo]

>Watch the whole thing! They compromised routers by using WMI (which allows remote management). They placed components into WMI to take control of routers. The person who taught Ron have a presentation to George Bush of how they can affect critical infrastructure with just the tools they had available. If they affected Telecommunications systems, then airtraffic control would be extremely difficult. They could affect the pipelines. 




TikTok is a Military Intelligence Tool!




When Russia invaded Ukraine, he deleted the World of Tanks , due to it being from Russian servers



TikTok is a military intelligence tool. It can detect if you are going to businesses of interest to the Chinese government. It is being used to prepare for an attack 3 years from now. There was a new statistic saying that millions of Tiktok users are using the app to get a fear response, disinformation, and other malicious intentions. 


The general populous is not aware that there is a cyberwar. They live their lives without knowing there is a cyber war. Ron mentioned that his mother during WWII went for a picnic with her friend. They accidently took a picture of the navy convoy in the Halifax harbor and lost their camera. There were many German agents in Halifax monitoring ship movements. Submarines were slipping by MacNabs island. 

The war is digital this time. Society is not aware of it. We do not live in ignorance. 

Make sure people are aware of the facts


Imagine having this type of monitoring. TikTok is completely banned in NSCC, so it should be removed. 



Ron will make a few modifications to the program this year, due to the CCP using certain techniques, attack methods, and Ron would like to discuss them so we can be prepared. 


There are two solutions : Defend the public  (be on the frontlines + provide support for Infrastructure + communicate the essential need for vigilance




CICS job : Most people do things backwards: most would go into a cyber program, learn , graduate and look for a job in cyber security. 


It should be done : look for a job that we want + look for the requirements in terms of education training + spend a couple of years teaching what you have learned.  


We should have a *target* in mind!


If interested, look for the requirements for the **Analyst Position**. Take care of all the needed skills to prepare for it, as it is still going to be around in 2 years. 


Canada has a problem : There is a Canadian center for cybersecurity, If you are a victim of a cyber attack, they are happy to aid you in dealing with the attack, and this is secondly a data point ( which means it is a vulnerability that could produce wider effects than the immediate corporation/individual). Canada is not good in the private sector level ( in terms of attack disclosure), and by knowing of all the cases, the bigger picture emerges. 


In first gulf war , the head general first aimed at the Iraqi army's eyes ( air force) , and then invade .


When dealing with cyber intrusions in isolation, we do not have a bigger picture. 


10 years ago, there was a lot of information sharing between the US and Canada. They engaged with the cyber force and academia in a huge scale. In Canada public sector does not talk to private sector. Ron thinks it is a budget problem. Every agency/department is fearful of losing some portion of their budget if they cooperated wit another agency, and they feel they should protect their domains. The creation for the Canadian Center for Cyber Defense is trying to encourage cooperation between public and private sectors

The message is : 

	Use this testimony this week to realize how real this is , and how important the role we are preparing for. Do not play a game online if we do not know where it came from. Facebook/social media gather the same data for intelligence purposes sometimes , marketing researcg etc ,m but the information they collect is still on this side . TikTok is on the other side. Huawei , TikTok etc collect info ... .
	
	
	In their testimony , they mentioned they do not attack civilian infrastructure. Prior to 2018, if they went to hack Iranian ministry of defence to place malware, this was considered an act of war. SO it was all theoritical. The John McCain act gave military coalitions in the west to "DEFEND FORWARD " : which means hack all foreign targets as muich as possible and place malware there in case of offensive operations. They make the point of how China focused on the civilian infrastructure due to it being so vulnerable. 



Microsoft released a description of what can be done to alleviate these attacks. WPA2 is the least requirement. In the past 30 days, Ron saw Win. 7 and XP boxes controlling critical infrastructure. Do not allow this type of stuff in the infrastructure. 


Ron almost got fired from Dell because Ron considered the job to keep Dell from harm. Ron treats systems he is responsible for the same way. Ron prevented a systems' admin from installing an addition to the server he is protecting, due to his reputation being on the line. Be polite and cooperative and professional, take personal ownership of the systems you are protecting like a Celebrity's Bodyguard. If the boss mentioned that they do not wish to ban Tiktok, leave the company, due to the fault being blamed on Ron and not the executive's wish to retain TikTok in the organization's network.
