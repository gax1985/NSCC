# IDS


## Definition : 


>Intrusion Detection System, which works on set rules 



### Example : 


	We have a policy in which Steam traffic is being detected, in which the detection would produce an alert to the System Administrator



### Real-World Example : 


>We will be setting up *Suricata*, which is an *Intrusion Detection System*

# IPS



## Definition :


>	Intrusion Prevention System , in which the system will automatically take actions based on pre-set rules



### Real-World Example : 


>	He was showing us *Ubiquiti*'s Intrusion Prevention Rules, which can double as Intrusion Detection Actions based on the *Traffic Rules*


>We have smarter IPS systems, in which they are smarter.


>[!note]
>There is an exploit for TCP traffic, in which certain flags for TCP traffic are not used. An attacker can utilize the *Flags* field in the TCP header, in which malicious code can be placed in the *Flags* field, in which the modern intelligent systems would be able to detect it, as it learns via machine learning or artificial intelligence, in which it detects methodology.

#### Distinctions between **IPS** and **IDS** :



Processing power has improved drastically. When Pentium came out, it was a transition from 486 to Pentium. This is why **IDS** and **IPS** are separate due to the processing power required. We need traffic to flow as effeciently as possible. Now, both can be incorporated together, and it is often together!



##### Traffic Flow

1. Firewall
2. IDS/IPS
3. Software Firewall
