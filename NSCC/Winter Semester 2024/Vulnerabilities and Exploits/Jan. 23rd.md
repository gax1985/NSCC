Fun Stuff : 



Each application would work on one distro only, so be aware! 





# History of Linux 



## 1980s : 



There was a **Standard Textbook** : "Computer Organization". It involved really complex programming assignments like a *Compiler*, where this program would analyze intructions, make them into the *Assembly Language*, and it was issued after the last exam. You had a week to finish it. It was never meant to be finished, but was designed to push you to your limits. Ron gave up after 3 days. 



In Tennabaum's book, he proposed a simple OS to teach uis how to program an Operating System. In **MS-DOS**, it was all command-line based. When **IBM** first produced the personal compyter, they needed an operating system. They contracted a company to come up with it. That company failed many deadlines, and IBM's release date for their personal computer was coming up. They put up an ad to look for someone to create the OS. *Bill Gates* responded to the ad, and his father helped Bill write the contract with IBM. They did not charge IBM for the OS, the contract stipulated that they get paid every time IBM sold the PC, regardless whether the PC had this OS or not. 



They set out to produce a Disk-Operating System : 


1. It goes to disk 
2. find executable
3. Load it into memory
4. Load the first line of the program, and let it work!



This contract was the foundation for **Microsoft**. Bill Gates was not a visionary. In the Tenenbaum book, you had to write a basic Disk-Operating System. Tenenbaum put the instructions for the OS he created in his book. 
Everyone in computer sceince did the exact same assignment. If youy have done it, you would have an OS just like MS-DOS. 



# Linux 


**Linux Torvalds** put that script and finished it. He called the OS *Linux*. People believe that *Linux* is Linus' Unix OS. He made it freely-available to the world. People liked Unix, but it ran on laboratories, and it was not suitable for the personal computer. Peolple did not like MS-DOS or Microsoft in general. *Linux* was great for smaller devices, due to it being basic and small in size. As it grew , people started producing their own versions of Linux. You would not be able to sell an Operating System that was based on it; you had to share it for free! It would have the kernel that Linus had created. 


There were earlier versions of Linux done by different people, which is known as a *Distribution*. Each distribution was free. 


Ian and Debra produced their own version using shortened versions of their name : **Debian**. It is free, and alot of people took Debian and expanded on it to create new distributions of Linux. One was called *Ubuntu*.  Debian was meant to be used on a *Workstation*, as compared to other distros being designed for an *Enterprise Server* like **RedHat**. With Redhat, there is a distribution called *Fedora*, which is also free to use. It does not have all the capabilities of the Redhat mothership. Redhat wanted to make money, so they wrote into their licensing that if you wish to use Redhat, the only way you can do it is to licvense additional services from them. You got the OS for free, but you get technical support and other bonuses that you pay for. Fedora exists for those who do not want that. 


There are multiple versions of Debian, Redhat, OpenSUSE , etc ... When looking at the **Fun Stuff** section in the course shell, you will see tools suitable for one distribution and not others.

## CRON Daemon 



This is Linux's Time Keeper. We would use it for automation and for running scripts on a particular schedule.

>The *Bandit* Assignment is set to show you the basic instructions that we would see in our other assignments. It is recommended to finish it, as it will help us with future assignments.

>You need a month of work for the **Final Project**. Do NOT expect to do the first idea you get, as you may have to be able to choose another potential path.  It is supposed to be a *Computer-Management Script*. You should push the boundaries! Consider inserting *hidden commands* to do things fort you like an *Easter-Egg*! This is a **Programming Class**, so he expects us to be *Adventurous!*. Check out the **Style Comments**, which will be useful ( such as *Commenting Blocks of Code* )
