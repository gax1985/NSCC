A lot of people set up a **Group** or an **Organizational Unit**.

### How to Disable the Local Administrator 



You need another **Domain Administrator** *before you do this!*



If someone makes a change to the domain as an *administrator*, we would know who did it!



DO not GET LOCKED OUT!



Take a *Snapshot!*



You can *dump your hashes*. He will teach us that later


## Users on the Domain 


netuser\domain



		netuser 


You have top be a user of a ticket granting service (kerberos)./ This has to be protected. The domain administrator + disabled guest account



You want to see the group you are in : 


		netuser 



netgroup /domain  (you see the groups in that domain) 





You can set up a new Organizational Unit. It os more for Policy than access control 






Adding a Wokstation 


You create another virtual machine. 


Windows 10 virtual machine 


2cores and four gigs of ram 



You would add the new computer 



Its a good idea to place your favoured Domain Controller in your DNS server .
