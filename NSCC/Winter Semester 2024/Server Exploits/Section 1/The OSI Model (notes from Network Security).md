1. Does every computer that accesses a network is government by the OSI model ? 
Answer : No!



A Computer ---? When any application has to access a network, or send a packet --> Packet gets built --> sends it through the **Network Stack** --> 



Application on Ron's OS

on 

**Application Layer** (Some people confuse the **Application Layer** with actual applications. In truth, it speaks the same language as applications. )

(Message gets encapsulated by the *Application Layer*  and gets passed down to the **Presentation Layer**)
|

**Presentation Layer**
(Computer Science is bad at naming, with a lack of imagination. It is a language translator. Ron's system could be a Windows PC, and the destination is a Linux Server for example. PC application asks the pc to do something/communicate, and asks the presentation layer to translate for the other PC's **Presentation Layer**. Operating Systems may translate Bytes differently, **Big Ending/Little Ending**. The **Presentation Layer** understands this, and makes the translation. "Presenting the message to the Application Layer"  )

|

**Session Layer**

(Have you ever left your pc and locked it, come back from the washroom, and you get greeted with a message "Your session has expired". This is due to rules pertaining to who and how long they can be idle for)
|

**Transport Layer** 

(VERY important later. As far as this layer is concerned, it is unaware of any intervening network. As far as it is concerned, it is speaking directly to the destination PC's Transport Layer. In TCP/IP network, it means it has a Transport layer and an Internet Protocol layer. At the **Transport Layer**, we have *source ports*, *destination ports*, *Protocols*. )
|

**Network Layer**

|


(We use it to find other computers in the world. This is where the **IP Address** is. The **Network Layer** will take the *IP addresses of Source and Destination* and everything it receives from the transport layer, encapsulates it, and sends it off. This layer IS aware of your network. It will know the private IP address on the destination computer)


|


**DATA Link Layer


(Used to talk to ALL the local machhines. Local networks do NOT use IP addresses. The **Data Link Layer** uses MAC addresses. At this point in the stack, it is accessing the **ARP Table**  to look at the IP address that was requested, and to see if the IP address exists on the network "ANyo e at this network with this IP address?" , and if the answer is "No?" The **Data Link Layer** sends it to the *Router*. "No computer on this local network has told me that it has THIS ip address. It must be somewhere else in the world, and I will pass it on to the gateway." The IP Address could be on another VLAN , or segment, or country etc... It has to get to the router, and talk to all the other PCs on its segment)

**Physical Layer**


(How is your computer connected to the network ? COAX? Bluetooth ? 
Whatever you are connected as, it is known as the **Physical Layer** prepares the electrical signal to go on the wire. Infrared networks utilizes Light Pulses to send the signal. Ron mentioned that when he was at DAL, he could not string cables due to high costs. They placed an oinfrared receiver and a countering sender between the two buildings. Fog hinders infrared. There were ALOT of packet loss. Throughput is : HOW MUCH DATA YOU CAN TRANSFER SUCCESSFULLY? The data did not always make it to the other end. )
