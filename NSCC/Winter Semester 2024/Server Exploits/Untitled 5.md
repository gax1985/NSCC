Passwords are stored in **/etc/shadow**, which is viewed only by the *root user*



We can use etc/passwd to make a new user. This is available for *backwards compatibility*



1. We will fix up the SSH to log in . Change it back to *Password Authentication*

   >1. Issue the following command : 
   > 		 sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   > 2. Look for "*PasswordAuthentication*" and set it to **Yes**
   > 3. Look for "*PermitRootLogin*" and set it to **Yes**


2. Change the permissions to 666 for the file */etc/passwd*
   
	sudo chmod 666 /etc/passwd


3. Get a reverse shell going with the available exploitation methods available on DVWA. We must verify that we are the *www-data* user with the **whoami** command





4. if we look at /etc/passwd, we would need the hash. **SHA256** is a good choice!
   
	   passwd -5 (sha256)
