>
>
>1. Let us make sure the server repositories are updated and upgraded : 
>
>
>		sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y 
>
>
>1. Let us check the current *Apache* version : 
  > 
>		apache2 -v 
> 
> 3. Let us upgrade *apache2* : 
>    
> 		   sudo apt-get upgrade apache2
>

>    
>    https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/apache2
>    
>    
> 		   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/apache2 
>  
>   5.   Now, the following command will successfully upgrade *Apache2* to the latest version : 
>    
>		sudo apt upgrade apache2
>
>
>6 . After we have upgraded *Apache2* to version 2.4.56, we can proceed with modifying the **/etc/apache2/apache2.conf** file :

>		sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
> 
>
>Where we would add the following bits to the */etc/apache2/apache2.conf* file :
