**Course Rationale**

The Operating System controls all aspects of a computer. As such, it is fundamental to all computing activities. Since its role is vital, and it is a well-known entity, the operating system can be a prime area for intrusion or exploitation. Providing a secure computing environment is a first principle of computer security, and it starts with the operating system. This course establishes a basis for understanding and executing those measures needed to provide such an environment.
