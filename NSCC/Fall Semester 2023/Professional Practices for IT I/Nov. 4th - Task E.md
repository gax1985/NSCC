WORK EXPERIENCE
STUDENT GUIDE 
 

Version 6.0 Work Experience Student Guide Page 3 
Introduction 
Most NSCC programs have a work-integrated learning component that provides students with an opportunity to 
combine their classroom learning with learning on the job to gain valuable work experience. Through these 
work experiences, employers also gain from the fresh perspective a student brings to the workforce and have an 
opportunity to evaluate and identify potential future employees as part of their long-term recruitment strategy. 
Not only do students and employers benefit, these work experiences help to raise the number of students who 
stay in Nova Scotia by increasing their chances of securing employment after graduation. 
This guide is designed to provide you with the information you need to prepare for your work experience. At 
NSCC we offer four broad categories of work experiences that prepare students for their professional or 
occupational field of study:
1. Field Experiences: can be either paid or unpaid work-related experiences. Field experiences and their 
outcomes are defined at the course level and are a requirement of graduation. Types of field experiences 
include job shadow, sea time, work term etc. The traditional work term is a 5-week work experience and 
typically occurs in the third term (April-May). However, many programs have multiple field experiences that 
vary in length and can take place throughout the program. 
2. Co-operative Education (co-op): allows a student to “earn as they learn” while gaining valuable experience 
as they prepare for their second year of studies, graduation and ultimately, employment in their career of 
choice. Co-op is paid, full-time employment that generally lasts 12-16 weeks, a minimum of 420 hours, and 
occurs between the students first and second year of study. 
3. Internships: Two NSCC programs include an internship, International Business and Ocean's Technology. 
These paid internships take place during the final term of the program and last approximately 14-16 weeks. 
4. Professional Practice: Unpaid work placements required for a professional license or designation (including 
clinical placement, practicums, preceptorships, etc.) 
As a learning-centered institution, the strategies used for developing, delivering, and assessing work 
experiences, first and foremost, take into consideration the learning needs of the student. The College will 
provide support for students to gain industry experience; however, in some circumstances a shortage of 
employer partners may necessitate providing students with an equivalent learning experience. 
NSCC tracks all student work experiences (other than professional practice placements) through NSCC’s Work 
Experience Portal. This portal allows us to record and track all work experiences in a single searchable catalogue. 
The Work Experience Portal includes a student’s personal information (Name, Email, Phone, Emergency Contact, 
Gender, Language, and Citizenship), employer-partner information, and work experience details (Start Date, End 
Date, Hours, Wage if applicable, etc.). Professional Practice placements are tracked in a similar but distinct 
system called the Professional Practice Portal that Nova Scotia Health and the IWK Hospital use to place 
students. 
NSCC is committed to controlling the collection, use, and disclosure of the information provided by students and 
employers. NSCC is also committed to the principle of informed consent and supports the right for the employer 
and student to know what information is on file. If there are any questions on privacy or data use, please 
contact us at WorkExperience@nscc.ca. 
If you have any questions related to your program’s work experience or work-integrated learning in general, 
please email us at WorkExperience@nscc.ca.

Version 6.0 Work Experience Student Guide Page 6 
Work Experience Procedures 
In many cases, students take responsibility for finding their own work experience and your faculty assist you 
with the process. However, in some programs, a work experience may be assigned to you (e.g., a clinical 
placement). It is important to note that faculty must approve all work experiences. 
Preparing for a Work Experience 
You are expected to attend a work experience information session to help you prepare for your search. 
Information sessions occur throughout the academic year and a recording is on Connect. 
You are also responsible for having an updated resume and cover letter ready to share with potential employers. 
Your faculty and campus Student Services team can assist you, there are also resources on the NSCC Library 
website. 
Career & Employment Services have created a Brightspace course called Career Jump Start (ESSS1020) which is a 
free, optional, non-credit course that covers career decision making, job searching, job application, and job 
maintenance. You can complete the modules in any order and at any time while you are a student at NSCC. To 
access the course, click on the Self-Registration link on your Brightspace home page, find the course name, and 
click register. The course will then move to your Brightspace home page for you to access at your convenience. 
Some employers may require you to provide Criminal Record Check (CRC), Vulnerable Sector Search (VSS), 
Vaccination/Immunization Records, and/or Child Abuse Register Checks prior to beginning your work 
experience. Any negative indicators on these checks may result in you being unable to complete your work 
experience, and thus, unable to complete all requirements of your program. 
For information on completing an International Work Experience (outside of Canada), or International Students 
(inside of Canada) please see the respective section in this Guide. 
NOTE: If you are participating in co-op, you must enroll in the co-op course. Co-op is an academic credit 
course, and as such, tuition fees apply. 
Finding a Work Experience 
Depending on your program, you may search for a work experience, or one may be assigned to you, consult your 
faculty on which approach is available for you. It is important that all work experiences provide a valuable 
learning experience and a safe environment for our students and as such all work experiences must be approved 
by your faculty or Academic Chair. 
Self-Directed Searches 
When sourcing your own work experience, the following criteria should be considered: 
• A clear connection exists between the work experience job description and your program of study 
• The employer will fulfill their responsibilities as outlined in the NSCC Work Integrated Learning Employer 
Guide 
• An acceptable standard of safety is maintained at the work site 
Should you require assistance with finding your work experience, connect with your faculty or Student Services 
Advisor for guidance and support. See Career and Employment Services on Connect for additional resources. 
Version 6.0 Work Experience Student Guide Page 7 
Student & Graduate Employment Site 
Many employers post work experience opportunities on NSCC’s Student & Graduate Employment Site, which 
you are encouraged to monitor regularly for new positions.
Interviews 
If desired, employers may reach out to arrange an interview at their convenience. Interviews can be conducted 
on-site, by phone, or through an appropriate form of technology. 
You will receive interview preparation either from your faculty and/or through your communications course. 
You can also practice your interview skills through the NSCC Library Writing Centre or with your Student Services 
Advisor. 
You can also practice responding to interview questions through InterviewPrep, an online mock-interview 
platform where you will find interview preparation resources. There are over 5,000 questions available and you 
get feedback on your interview skills. 
It is important that you research the company before your interview and bring along your updated portfolio to 
present during your interview. If you miss a scheduled interview, you may be required to write a letter of 
apology to the employer. 
Accepting a Work Experience Offer 
The employer may contact your faculty to extend an offer, or they may contact you directly. You must obtain 
faculty approval prior to accepting any offers. 
You are required to respond to work experience offers within two (2) business days. Do not tentatively accept 
an offer while waiting to find out about another position. This could cause employers to question your 
responsibility and maturity, and possibly result in an employer withdrawing from the work experience program. 
During Your Work Experience 
As the College considers work experiences to be an extension of your studies, you are encouraged to connect 
with your faculty regularly throughout. Communication is key for a successful work experience! 
Faculty will schedule check-ins with you and your employer to monitor job safety and performance. The 
frequency of these check-ins will be determined by your faculty. These will be done either through technology 
or in-person depending on the situation and location of the work experience. During these conversations your 
faculty will be assessing your relationships with others, dependability, ability to learn, attitude, judgement, 
professional appearance, attendance, punctuality, overall work performance, and areas that need 
improvement. 
If there are changes in your work assignment, any situations occur that cause you stress, or if your position is 
terminated prematurely, do not wait for the check-in, notify your faculty as soon as possible. In the case where 
the employer has requested that you to come to the physical worksite, it is crucial that you do not go to any 
physical work location without faculty approval. 
It is also important for you to participate in your Brightspace course during your work experience. Your 
Brightspace course will have discussion topics which will be helpful when completing the evaluation portions of 
your work experience. 
Orientation 
Employers are required to provide you with an orientation on your first day of work. The orientation will assist 
you with establishing clear objectives, duties and responsibilities for your work experience, allow you to get 
acquainted with your worksite (either onsite or remote), and understand the organization itself. 
Version 6.0 Work Experience Student Guide Page 8 
Job Safety Review 
Another component that must be discussed during your orientation is job safety. This is when you will learn 
about your employer’s Occupational Health & Safety Policies, layout of the worksite, job hazards, etc. to ensure 
you are aware of safe work practices. 
Confidentiality 
Confidentiality is imperative to maintaining privacy, security, and trust in professional and personal interactions. 
In situations where sensitive information is shared or accessible, confidentiality is mandatory. You will be 
required to hold in confidence all information regarding clients, policies, and work materials that you may 
acquire or be privy to throughout your work experience. However, it will be necessary to share general 
information with your faculty as it relates to your educational experience. 
Release of Information 
During your work experience your faculty and employer will need to communicate regarding your performance. 
In accordance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPOP) and the Personal 
Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), it may be required to have communications and 
certain information released to your employer in order to obtain a credit for your course. 
Accident/Incident Reporting 
During your work experience, it is important to know what to do and who to contact if you find yourself in an 
unsafe or disrespectful working environment. 
If you feel unsafe, or that you are in a disrespectful working environment, your first step is to contact your 
faculty – do not wait for a scheduled Check-in. If needed, you can also reach out to Career & Employment 
services at workexperience@nscc.ca. 
In case of a serious accident or incident requiring ambulance transport, hospitalization, or emergency care, 
contact the office of NSCC Occupational Health, Safety & Environmental Services IMMEDIATELY at 902-491-
7233. 
If the accident/incident is not serious in nature: 
 You must complete the work experience Accident/Incident Report and connect with your 
faculty/Academic Chair. 
 Completed forms must be submitted to NSCC’s Career & Employment Services by email -
WorkExperience@nscc.ca 
 Career & Employment Services will forward the completed form to your faculty, Academic Chair, 
Principal, and NSCC’s Occupational Health, Safety & Environmental Services. 
 Upon receipt of the completed Accident/Incident Report, if you and your faculty/AC have yet to 
connect, they will make every effort to contact you. 
Evaluation of Work Experience 
Faculty will grade you based on your performance during your work experience. Grades will appear on your 
transcript as either a “P” (pass), “F” (fail), or “I” (incomplete). 
The employer must provide feedback on your performance at the end of the work experience, and you are also 
required to provide feedback on your employer. For more information on evaluation visit your Brightspace 
course. 
Version 6.0 Work Experience Student Guide Page 9 
NSCC’s Work-Integrated Learning & Co-op Student of the Year Awards 
Each year, NSCC awards one “Co-op Student of the Year” and one “WIL Student of the Year”. If you and/or 
your employer want to nominate you, you must initiate an application through NSCC’s Student Awards portal 
(https://studentawards.nscc.ca/). Once you begin the application process, your faculty and employer will be 
asked to support your application by explaining the impact you had on the College and/or their organization. 
A committee will review the applications, and the award will be given to the winning student at their campus 
awards ceremony in June. 
With consent, the winner of these awards will then be nominated for the CEWIL Canada award. These 
nominations must be received at the CEWIL Canada office in January each year. The winning students will 
receive $1,000 (a CEWIL Canada award of $500 and the Emery-Dufault award of $500). More detail on this 
award can be found on the CEWIL Canada website: https://www.cewilcanada.ca/. 
Health & Safety 
Student health and safety is a priority. Safety is a shared responsibility amongst NSCC, the employer, and the 
student. Insurance and risk management practices are of the utmost importance in ensuring your health and 
safety. 
To demonstrate NSCC’s due diligence, it is important that risk assessments are completed, required forms are 
reviewed and signed, and safety plans are in place. NSCC maintains several insurance policies to protect 
students, employees, and the organization. These include insurance against errors and omissions, general 
liability, and student accident insurance should any accidents or incidents occur. 
Student Insurance 
Most students are automatically enrolled in or covered by existing NSCC insurance plans while engaged in work 
experience activities. The Student Insurance Program (SIP) protects students in the event of a workplace 
accident for some expenses not covered by NS Medical Services Insurance Program (MSI). If the student is from 
another province in Canada, they have basic coverage provided by the equivalent Medical Services Insurance 
program from their home province. The same is applicable for students from Nova Scotia who intend to 
complete their work experiences in another province. Students should only apply to change their provincial 
health care if they live in the new province for 183 days of the calendar year. 
If the employer is paying a wage as part of the work experience, as a paid employee, students are covered by 
the employer’s workers compensation (WCB) account. Students engaged in paid work experiences are also 
covered by existing NSCC Insurance plans while active in work-integrated learning activities. 
NSCC’s General Liability insurance protects students and the College in the event that a student causes bodily 
injury or property damage to a third party while on work experience. Students in Health & Human Services 
programs are also covered also medical malpractice coverage. 
*For information on insurance for international work experience and/or international students please refer to the 
International sections of this guide. 
 
Version 6.0 Work Experience Student Guide Page 10 
Employer Insurance 
In most cases, NSCC requires that employers carry a general liability insurance policy of at least $2 million. This 
not only protects our students, but also demonstrates that the employer promotes safe workplace and risk 
management practices. 
Some employers may not carry the minimum general liability insurance to guard against risk within their 
organizations. In these cases, NSCC may allow a work experience with these employers if the following process is 
completed. 
1. Student and faculty, in conjunction with the employer, complete the Work Experience Agreement form. 
2. The agreement is reviewed by the Academic Chair, who assesses the level of risk. 
3. If comfortable with the level of risk, the Academic Chair consults with OHSE to confirm his/her 
assessment of the risk. 
4. If all parties are comfortable with the level of risk, the Academic Chair and supervising faculty sign-off 
with their approvals. 
Exceptions are NOT possible if the work experience takes place in an industrial, construction, healthcare, or 
aviation setting, or any other setting that would be considered as potentially hazardous or high risk. 
For more information, please see the Work-Integrated Learning Insurance Guidelines under Hire a student on 
NSCC’s website. 
Risk Management 
Effective risk management is an integral part of work experiences. It is important for faculty and Academic 
Chairs to ensure students are placed in safe work environments, and to ensure students are aware of the 
employer's safety program and policies. 
Prior to the start of a work experience, faculty and students are responsible for completing the Work Experience 
Agreement form (located on Connect) jointly with the employer. This agreement will help to identify any job 
hazards and control measures, determine any personal protective equipment that is required, and ensure the 
employer has the appropriate liability insurance. The original copy of this completed form must be kept with the 
Academic Chair while the student is on their work experience. 
Safe & Respectful Environment 
NSCC is committed to ensuring that all students and employees learn and work in a safe environment, free from 
discrimination and harassment, and conducive to learning and teaching. 
NSCC is also committed to ensuring fair and equitable treatment of all members of its community, while 
maintaining the academic integrity of programs and curriculum, and an academic climate conducive to learning, 
free from disruptive or inappropriate behaviour.
