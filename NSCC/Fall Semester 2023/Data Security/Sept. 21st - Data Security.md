Look up **Snatch Ransomware**


Dagos is part of the banner  SQL . When you have a massive organization that has SQL vulnerabilities.


He will be showing us later how to hack DNS systems

Test scores are in. 2 people had Question 1 correctly!


Average score is 5.2 , median is 5.5. If you are significantly below that, you need some extra work and some extra effort.

We were talking about **cyberoperator**, and if you are thinking of signing up for operations in the forces, if you sign up for the cyberoperator in this program, you get $20K cash bonus, and you have to do basic training. You can retire with full medical pensions in 25 years. If the average age is late 20s, you would be set up. You can start your next career if you want after you retire, and you would still have a pension.


Some people ask Ron why he is here? his goal was to finish his career in the classroom. He had to choose a place to teach. He was on advisory boards etc... (The secret in NS' cyber community is to attend NSCC). He was mentoring students, and thought it was obvious to teach cybersecurity here. Everyone here has been practicing this skill professionally. He does not mean to disrespect, but alot of instructors in other institutions never left the classroom. 


Karly will be the head librarian at NSCC. She can be a huge help to us!


He insists on to have very professional writing resource skills. Others have been fired from their jobs due to their lack of writing skills. We are reading --> writing --> presenting! 


We will focus  a  lot on professional referencing standards. We will receive top level training, and Karly will be showing us the standards. If you have any questions, Karly will be happy to assist! 


Karly : We will be working with very fussy materials. 


#### Why is it important to cite sources? 

1. Avoiding plagiarism 
2. Find the sources of information that we have used
3. Providing credibility , and that we have done the work
4. Citing sources and referencing resources will make the arguments stronger. It helps convince people!
5. When talking to fellow IT individuals and stakeholders, we need to sell what we are doing. At the end of the day, instead of opting for the cheapest or fastest option, we can convince the stakeholder of an essential option on the larger picture.


- NSCC uses the **APA** citation style. 
-  Slides will be available on Brightspace


- [ ] We need to cite each source twice ; in the body of the essay (as a heads up!)
- [ ] At the end, we will have a references page/slide giving fuller details. A copy of 377 pages of the APA reference guide is available at the library
- [ ] We need to represent NSCC as  an institution. We need to upkeep it!


###### Plagiarism :

	Presenting in any format someone else's work, which may include ideas, presentations, writing,m artistic work and creations. 


She noticed most plagiarism is through **rushing** or **carelessness**.

Ron : 
	If you are plagiarising in terms of incorrect citations, he will work with us on that. But if it is intentional, we would have a meeting with the board of NSCC


#### Common Knowledge


	Knowledge known by most people.

###### Examples :

1. Sky is Blue!
2. 100 degrees Celsius is the boiling point of water
3. Asthma is a disease in the lungs


Citations for common knowledge is not needed!


Ex. 

	She did a research paper on the Ming Dynasty. If you are from China, it would be common knowledge to know China's history for example. 

Another Ex. 

	When we work in cybersecurity, common knowledge would be evident in commonly-known information among cybersecurity professionals


When dealing with stakeholders, who are not from an IT background, they are most likely coming from an academic background. 


#### APA


2 different methods of doing citations : 


#### Direct Quote 

	When quoting material word-for-word from someone else. Direct quotations can be used when the writer has written it so well you will include it as-is

Benefit : You can retain it better when you quote it!

- [ ] Exact Words!
- [ ] In text, list the **Author** , **Year**, and **Pagination** intext and include a complete reference in the reference list(aka bibliography).
- [ ] Citation generators can help, but she is not convinced. They can possibly help with a huge piece of written work with 3-pages of sources.


###### Examples : 

1. According to .... Research center(2021), .....   "  (para. 4)
2. Pew Research Center (2021) says " ....." (para. 4)   
3. Research indicates that " ......"(Pew Research Center, 2021. , para4) but did not explain why (This is a traditional approach)

	you name the author in your own writing, and references and paragraph number comes at the end of the quote. This helps in reasserting our point.



#### Indirect Quote

	Paraphrasing an idea from another author's work, by using thier ideas or information, but you MUST do it in your own words. 

Benefit : To over-use direct-quotation, then it would pose a question in Ron's mind about whether we actually understand the material. Some instructors indicate that they allow one direct-quote-per-paper. If you want to lose grades, if we are to quote the author repeatedly, the lack of your own personal voice would hinder your progress. 


###### Examples

Paraprase : "Facebook continues to dominate social media PLATFORMS" 

OR 

Paraphrase : People prefer Facebook to other social media platforms ."(Pew Research Center, 2021. , para4) 



- [ ] List Author, Year intext
- [ ] Include a complete reference list
- [ ] Pagination is NOT required



Question: paraphrasing allows you to adjust the information for your audience's taste. 

Answer : Stakeholders can understand the material better if it was personalized. 


Question : If we take a whole entire book, and we add quotations at the start and at the end, do we get into copyright infringement territory ? 

Answer : There are alot of authors do really well financially as authors, but other authors are much less well-off. As for quoting a whole entire book, it is a decent way to fail. Being able to understand the content and to demonstrate your knowledge, but quotes should be used judiciously 


If you have any questions, please visit the library. 


There is the **Writing Center** : 

	An online support space where we can get help with any aspect in our writing. They can help with presentations, resumes, cover letter, or any other written materials such as notes. It is a mutual effort, so one must write to help oneself. 



Ron :

#### Problems with automated referencing : 


1. They do not survive Brightspace's formatting 
2. You do not learn anything! 

He encourages us to do it manually, so when producing the table of contents, indent citations, reference format and so on. If he saw garbled citations, we will receive a lower grade.





#### Corrosponding Sources in Reference List 


Examples : 


###### References


Allen, J. F., Jr., (2013) Health Law and medical ethics for healthcare, Publishing house



#### Reference List 

	Recorded twice!


1. Cited in text:  author-date citation
2. Listed in the reference section 


###### Formatting : 

Begin on a separate page
Label page References centered at the top.
Double-spaced
Hanging Indent
Italicize titles
List DOI of articles if present
URLs for web sources

###### Organization 

	Alphabetical by surname of the first author or first word in name of organization 

##### Exception to the Rule (excluded from Reference List)

Personal communications appear only in text




#### Common Types of References 

Non periodical 


Who wrote it ? who made it? who built it? 

next ..

When was it written? list month/day/year. It is ok if we have just the year. If date not listed ? date unknown , or today's date. You can say ND (no date). Do NOT guess. 

When looking at web-based sources, need to know the date of the banner next to the copyright statement at the button (not needing copyright statement), but there will be date of the page. We need to know when it was published originally.

next ..

Title !

For web-based sources, we need the links!



Examples of intext citations : 


If you have one or two authors, list them all!
(Jones & Silverstein, 2009)
If you have three or more, direct quote
(Ericson et al. "others", 2014, p. 270)

Example : website, direct quote

(American Kennel Club, 1993, para. 2)

If we do not know the author , we need to check with faculty as it might not be reputable!

DO NOT USE BIBLIOGRAPHY
Everything in the references page must be cited in the document 


#### AI 


If we do not know, ChatGPT and other large language models, can include inaccuracies. 


If we ask it for an essay, it will include formatted citations but they turn out to be false. 


We should be transparent about it!


This is not new. She remembers that there was a subject she was interested in and wanted to write two essays on the same subject, but to reuse an older research paper, then it would be **self-plagiarism**. She had a discussion with her faculty about the first paper, and she was asked to see what interests her in it, and which points interest her the most. Then, she was asked to focus on those points specifically. Being transparent helps as the faculty will help us get to the goal. 


If we use AI to generate ideas, create a study guide and other ethical ways could be valid. The issue is asking AI to generate essays and other written works. 

Reference (citing ChatGPT)
How you used it ? 
The prompt
and the relevant portion of the text

Chats are not retrievable by others, because the content is generated by a system, and it is sharing an algorithm's output.  by providing a citation 


Example : Prompt "Is the left brain right brain divide real or a metaphor?"

ChatGPT lies. You can ask it to produce a portion of an essay, and it will produce it, but it will be false. Ron's PHD is in AI, it is usually aweful and incorrect, do not trust it, and we are training to be countering criminals, not become one. OpenAI is being sued by many Authors due to ChatGPT using their materials to produce works.

#### Exercise Examples 


What are we looking at ?

	We are looking at an electronic article, which is from The U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 


What kind of source is this ? 

	It is an electronic article!

How do we write our reference? 

The  U.S.  Department of Homeland Security [CISA.gov]. (2023 Sept. 20th) *Shields Up: Guidance for Families*

https://www.cisa.gov/shields-guidance-families

###### Correction : 

Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency [CISA] 'more specific'. (n.d. 'we do not have the date'). *Shields Up: Guidance for families* 'They want captilization of first word and pronouns'
https://www.cisa.gov/shields-guidance-families   --- > Website 


(Do not leave hyperlinks, but it is not the *end of the world ...*)


Equal Rights for LGBTQ+ Protest Movement for CYber Crime 

Who organized it? who funded it? when did it start ? 



#### 2nd Practice Example 


What are we looking at ? 
A news article pertaining to Canada's Cybersecurity chief urging closer collaboration between Canada, the US to fend off threats 

What  kind of  source is it ?


	A news article from CBC's Political News section of their website 


How do we write our reference? 

	CBC is not a research source. When we look at page 4 of an example!

So ...

	Authors name (if one person, invert the name so lastname, firstname. Whatever they provide!) 

McCarten, J.  


	Then, the date : 

McCarten, J.  (2023, Sept. 9th) *Cybersecurity chief urges closer collaboration between Canada, U.S. to fend off threats*

	When dealing with news sources as this or journals, we need to list the article's name and where it comes from  , so ...


McCarten, J.  (2023, Sept. 9th) *Cybersecurity chief urges closer collaboration between Canada, U.S. to fend off threats. CBC News.* https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-us-cybersecurity-cooperation-1.6961875 


Hanging-Indent


Highlight the paragraph , access "Line-spacing options." , then we get to the "hanging indentation" option


Standard font : 12 points --> it may be small for some.
Caligri or Times New Roman 


###### Ron's Recommendations : 

Caligri or Times New Roman 


NO FOOTNOTES --- APA does not like footnotes

Common mistakes on the 1st assignment : 

References page is a page by itself. The headings is references not bibliography. Every reference in the paper needs a intext citation (which part of the text are you referring to? show me where you find it). References as footnotes (mistake)


No Wikipedia citations. Start with Wikipedia, but verify it by going to their reference and cite the reference. Anyone can edit the page. 


LOST show : Hurley went back in time to the 1980s and wrote "Empire Strikes Back", and on Wikipedia someone edited the date to match the show. 


It takes practice!
