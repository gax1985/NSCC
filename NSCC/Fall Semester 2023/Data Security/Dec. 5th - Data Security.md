>  If we are failing the course, we can ask the instructor for an **Incomplete** status instead of a *FAIL*. You would sign the "Learning Contract", which expires two weeks into January. "*Student needs to complete the Final Assignment in two weeks, where the Incomplete Status would be replaced by 65%*". This is negative : in January, you would have six courses , plus this project.
