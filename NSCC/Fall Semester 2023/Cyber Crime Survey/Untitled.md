China has a 5-year plan, so they focus on an industry for the next five years. 


Honda generators are made in China, but they make duplicates and change the name 


Production companies would have to accept the fact that the Chinese entities will steal their designs and sell them, as the cost of iffy labor standards, and human rights abuses


There was someone who was focused on manufacturing pins. The Chinese government gave him enough land to build a city, and he went to villages and got everyone to work on these pins


China is Communist, but they have the most unregulated private industry in the world


If you are manufacturing something in a place that is unregulated, you would prefer China



If someone made China look bad, the manager of the plant would be executed (hanged)

China is focused on Africa. China is trying to be THE global leader. Ron expects a fight between China and Russia. China does this economically and financially : they steal industrial secrets, set up unregulated manufacturing, biggest lender to the US. Africa has a lot of resources, and a target of industrialization. Originally, a lot of business went to India. The standard of living started to rise; the labor costs went up in India. Same thing is happening in China. Africa has a lot of young people desperate to improve their lives and face disease, warfare, and other issues. The West and China both want to build the infrastructure to build resources and set up the younger people of Africa to work in industry. China will go into an African nation, and announce that they would like to build their roads and hospitals without any conditions, but with an unofficial expectation down the line for a favor returned

If we are looking at China and the Himalayas and India : How much of China is Tibet? India chose Russia, because they are India's bully's enemy


Everyone in Russia hates Putin, except old school Communists. They see him as rebuilding the strength of the Soviet Union. If someone is looking at the UK from 1948 onwards, you would not imagine Queen Elizabeth not being there.  The Russian economy is in turmoil. Certain Russians are trying to assassinate Putin. Everyone in the world is wondering how to get close to Putin physically to get rid of him, and if that happens, it will be disasterous times economically. Between Russia and China, Russian economy is in dire straits, while China has a stable economy. The fear is Russia using tactical nukes in Eastern Europe
