We are beginning the discussion of the hacking community. 


### Anonymous


Has been known as the biggest group


Has people within its ranks that have created the internet


They have a range of moral ethics among their members


Some are motivated by the common social good. 


One of the puzzles involving Anonymous that they are seen as a gang; a gang has structure, etc... none of this is true. 


Anyone here can be a member in Anonymous 


You do not need to know anyone to join 



They did a huge role in the Arab Spring. They restored Internet in Egypt, in Libya's civil war .... anywhere their skills can be used to punish someone or support someone. Even if someone is not guilty or deserving of punishment...


If someone is accused of something, they might go after him/her in spite of lack of evidence


TRhey are unstructed, unfeathered, and skilled/unskilled. 


###### The Beginning


Chris Poole 

	aka ... "moot"


In some cases, we only know people by their nickname


If someone asks , who is the most skilled hacker in the world? not known 

He liked Anime. There was a Japanese website that went by different names, known as "2-chan"

"2-chan" is for the discussion of Anime. The members did not want people who are not speaking Japanese. 

He copied the entire 2chan code, and created a new server in the US called "4-chan".


In 4-chan he created rooms, and its content is intensly disgussting. The aim is to disturb people to keep them away, and to feel uncomfortable. Alot of these people if you were to meet them would not have the same personality in life as they would online. Some of this group's members are truly disturbing. 


In 4-chan, there were no usernames, but they had a way to differentiate people. If you did not have a "tripcode" or anything differentiating your identity, your name would appear as "Anonymous". Members who support Anonymous posting on 4-chan called themselves **Anon**. The time-frame is 2003-today. 


Most of the really interesting activities started in 2005.


One of the groups/discussion areas were about a hacking attack. Ex. attacks against a company because they are against people, nature, too capitalistic, selling a game for a terribly high price, oppressive governemnts etc. If you want to organize a campaign, you can start a private channel to coordinate activities etc. 


In the early days of hacking (late 1990s-2000s), there was a hacker called "Sabu". He was very talented, middle-aged, technically-skilled, a good manager,etc... around 2007, he disappeared. With the emmergance of 4-chan, he came back and became involved again, and put together campaigns. He attracked the attention of other hackers, and they formed a major team that scared everyone. There was another member of the group named "T-Flow" ...


T-Flow was akin to a second-in-command. He was highly skilled, and a quiet and strong person in the group. He did not boast about  it. He seemed to be in his mid-twenties. 


"Kayla" terrified everyone. She was very forward about her activities. She was 16 years old.  She was extremely skilled. Her father was a professor in Computer Science. She was taught programming when she was 4 years old. Her computers booted from USB dongles, and would conceal the USB drive if arrested. Sometimes others tried to mess with Kayla but were stopped. 


"Topiary" had no hacking skills. He was really good at writing and speaking. If there was an announcement to be done, or needed to communicate with the press, he would be the go-to person. 


The group went after organizations for fun or for punishment. 


All four formed a group called "Walsack". The core members of Anonymous were terrified of Walsack. Anonymous made a statement before about Walsack recognizing the group's skills. 


There was a company that did digital forensics for both the government and the private sector. The owner of the company wanted to branch off to focus on cybersecurity and forensics. HB Gary was a well-known company. They made quality software. The owner of this company hired someone named Aaron Barr, who was placed in charge of HB Gary Federal ; it would focus on government contracts. He was a very intelligent person. He was told that he would have to go and do this. He was encouraged to become visible in the market. He hired a couple of individuals, but at its height, the branch had 3 individuals in it. 

Aaron thought the best way to prove his worth is to take down Anonymous. Aaron Barr kicked a hornet's nest. He announced that he developed a piece of software recognizing all the leaders of Anonymous by their real identities. He actually went into the Dark Web and 4-chan, and created a persona for himself within the group, as well as a real persona as himself. His amazing software was to log in to 4-chan or another chatroom, he would monitor social media accounts for skilled individuals in the IT industry. When someone in 4-chan logged off, and they logged in via social media, he theorized that it would identify himher as a member of Anonymous. The FBI was interested, and he announced at a conference in 2011 Feb 1st or 2nd, that he will meet with the FBI. 

On Friday Feb. 4th, Topiary and others managed to get in to all HB Gary systems around the world. They called their system admins in Europe, and claimed to be from the company, and that they encountered an issue with the password. They asked to reset the password and asked for the new password. They called again mentioning that they could not remember the username. In terms of HB Gary Federal, they found an account. They did an SQL Injection attack, and exposed all the company's data. Aaron Barr reused the same password on every account he used, including top-secret government accounts. By late Friday, they grabbed every file from HB Gary, including discussions between Federal government and security agencies about controlling the economy. Aaron Barr was not aware. He was watching a Superbowl game, and noticed that his phone was not beeping with messages. He logged in to his email, and was locked out. He was locked out from every account. He went to look at his accounts online, and noticed that his profiles described him in the most obscene way possible. The comapny's secret illegal  activities with the government was exposed. They did a massive clean-up of the aftermath. At one point, by using his secret hacking persona, they tried to recruit him for a campaign to make the life of a particular cybersecurity company tough to mess with him and to scare him. HB Gary went out of business. 


The world discovered the group in this way. The group, while active, were getting away with a lot of activities. 

Consider Kayla, as a 16-year old hacker :P

T-Flow

Same person online as in real-life. 


Topiary

Lived in a little island in Northern Scotland. 

Jesten 

	"Jesten" is a nickname

Noone knows who he is. Claimed to be from a military background. Sells mechandize. He is suspected of being a character made by three intelligence agencies. No one knows who he is.





Anonymous was very active in the Syrian civil war. Someone leaked tank movements in Syria, and the group that was helping him ( a member is a friend of Ron), found out that the government tracked his location, and told him to get his family out of there and to escape. He was killed during shelling. His wife and his brother had cellphones. With Geosynchronous coordiantes , people in Canada were guiding his family in real time to avoind the Syrian troops. The syrian army intercepted their communications and the family was executed live in view of the Canadians who were helping them. 


Anonymous tries to block governements' abilities to gather intelligence, maintaining internet connectivity , etc. 

Ron became familiar with the group after Luitea Parson's case. She was abused, filmed and the video was shared. She tried to prosecute her assilants, and they threatened her, as well as stabbing one of her friends. Noone helped her, and she was abused by the system. She committed suicide. He used this incident to educate families and to help them in this sort of situation. 


Someone made a public speech about Anonymous : "I do not know who you are, but someone must be skilled enough to find you. Please come and help". There was an announcement few days later "To the abusers of Luteia Parson, to the NS governement : You have greatly angered the hive. We are Anonymous. We are Legion, we do not forgive, we do not forget, expect us. 
Evidence was gathered.

If you ask Anonymous for help in a situation, you are most likely to get attacked yourself. 



Not Your F****** Army


"Help me Anonymous!"
Anonymous : We are not your f****** army! prepare to get hacked!



A girl's ex-boyfriend was hacking her account, and was threatening to share her nude pictures with everyone. Someone messaged her telling her that the group that is threatening her will be stopped, but she has to do what the other group asked , but for him only. The hacker got the ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend to take a picture of them carrying a sign mentioning their stupidity. Search for images " Shoe on head". This person stopped the abuse, but became the abuser in return. 



He would like us to become familiar with the profile. Malicious hackers come from broken homes, poor upbringings, no friends in real-life, poor social skills, etc... with varying levels of intelligence. They have very little distractions, and they will focus on their goal until they reach it. 

Ron went to school with someone who was very antisocial. They had a broken down computer lab in school that no one used except him. He frequented that room all the time. He was exhibiting behaviour involving hacking into the students' accounts, and was recognized immediately. His parents were computer science professors. He was not skilled. He did not know how to cover his tracks. He focused on only breaking into the students' accounts. The moral of the story is dedication. When looking at these people, a pattern emerges. A few things are amiss : most hackers are men (mixed bag of men to women), anti-social (not necessarily), etc. 



Anonymous has a mythos in society, and end up escaping punishment by getting hired to maintain cybersecurity for companies on the internet. 


After the break : research these guys! Get to know them! No head , no leader, noone owns them, ranging cyber skills. Have they done good? depends on the definition. Lynch mobs have no concept of innocence ... you would get the lynch mob that you create. Sometimes this group messes up and someone ends up being killed a consequence

###### Denial of Service Attacks


	Overloading the server to prevent anyone from getting access to it. Usually done with a Botnet.


Anyone can join an Anonymous operation. If they do not receuit you they might attack you for the Lulz (for fun and entertainment). If you decided to join an operation for attacking the Wesboro Baptist Church 


LOIC -- Software that fires packets at this website to knock the website down. It was initially created with the intention of seeing the server's endurance. LOIC is traceable. Mafia Boy took down CNN out of Quebec. He launched the attack against multiple websites, and forgot to shut it down. The police came for him that evening.  Anonymous authored their own version where it hides the location, parallel attacks, and called it "HOIC" - High Orbit Ion Canon. The foot soldiers get arrested. Organizers usually are not in the country (aka... if attacking Libya, they would be outside of Libya). There are tools out there used by Anonymous that we will learn about. 


NEVER go to a website and download a hacking tool. If you hear about a website offering crypto mining tool, do not visit it. You are downloading something from criminals that get a great deal of entertainment with attacking you for fun. Anonymous carry a lot of problems with them, and innocent people get hurt. A bunch are fundamentally evil. 


Next week : He will give us a list of hackers (24 people). He would like us to create a small profile for each one of them. Each are chosen for a reason , either to show the evolution of hacking , presenting a precedent (unusual circumstances etc, one example was someone who did attacks out of Australia with a botnet. The enforcement agencies formed a "bot-roast" where they would target one botnet/malicious actor. They had a campaign for months that was costly just to track him down. They found him in Australia.  He was brought up before a judge. He was 17 years old. The judge argued that it is ridiculous to charge a 17 year old with cyber crimes, and threw out the case. He had multiple accounts. The judge did not know what a botnet was. In these profiles, we will have people like that. It is meant to understand the enemy, who the hacker is and how they become to be hackers. The background of events take place. 


Due date for OSINIT : He needs to see the project as early as possible, so we can do it together if need be. GET IT DONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! before the end of September.
