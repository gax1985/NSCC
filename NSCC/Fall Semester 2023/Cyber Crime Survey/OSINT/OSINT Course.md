>1. Create a VMWare Virtual Machine for **Buscador**, which is a Linux Distribution especially made for OSINT 
>2. Set up burner social media accounts
>3. Set up a new email address with http://www.gmx.com (They do not require a second email address for verification purposes)
>4. Create a burner phone number with VOIP



## Steps of an OSINT Investigation : 


#### 1. Start with what we know!

> [!hint] 
> If we had a little tidbit, such as a phone number or email address, that is a good starting point



#### 2. Define what we need!


> [!todo] 
>  Make a list of the information that we need, akin to the time of doing a research, and defining the sections of the paper, with an overall plan

 
###### Data of interest : 

1.Usernames/ Employee names

> [!help] 
> If you go to a person's Facebook page, you can check the source code for their **Entity ID**, which remains constant regardless if they changed their name or not! 

2. Interests 
3. Relationship status
4. Aliases
5. Geolocation 
6. Vehicle Information (VIN, Make/Model, etc)
   
   > [!help] 
> If you go to http://www.progressive.com and enter the person's address, you would get their vehicle information! 
   
7. Residence Information
   
   >[!Help]
>
If you go to [https://www.zillow.com] and enter the person's address, you would get information regarding their home, including photos of the interior!
   


#### 3. Collect the data!




#### 4. Analyze what we have!



#### 5. Pivot by using the newly-gathered data!



#### 6. Prove/Disprove a hypothesis!




#### 7. Produce a report!
