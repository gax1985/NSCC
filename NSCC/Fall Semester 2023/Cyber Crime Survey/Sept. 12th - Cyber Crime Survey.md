Sept 19th - Last day to withdraw from the program 

Withdrawal from the program : 65% of the time he decided the course/program is not for him, he would withdraw before the withdrawal's deadline


We have an October 2nd. Long Weekend. Do we know what this holiday is about? within his lifetime, 50 years ago, if you were an Indigenous family in Canada, and you had a child, they would take the child forcibly to a remote facility (residential schools), where they were beaten and raped repeatedly, many were killed in unmarked graves, and those who escaped often froze to death. You would be beaten if you spoke your language, or expressed your culture. This was done before by wiping out a culture. Those who made it to be 15 years old were traumatized for the rest of their lives. Indigenous friends of Ron mentioned that beliefs take 7 generations to be erased. 

There are efforts to reconcile from this dark past. Western civilizations did terrible things to their people. Nazi Germany was an example. Ron was raised in a home for abandoned children. On this long weekend, we are supposed to reconcile and reflect upon this tragedy.

### Our Adversaries


Some of the people that we study are essentially evil ðŸ˜ˆ

There was one individual who had the biggest Botnets of the world. He was known to kidnap preteen disabled children and torture them and videotapped it. thus ...


Some are teens who are script kiddies ...


and others who are government actors 



He dropped an investigation where one partner was in China, and another partner was in Halifax. He was investigating a theft of CAD 20000 a day losses. He was an independent operator, and his children would have been threatened. He went to the organization and withdrew from there. He believed and they did as well that it was an inside job. One of their IT members suddenly flew to China and never came back. He had to put a person undercover in the company. He went to an investigation firm, found someone who is profecient in IT, got them hired (with the assistance of a leading member of the company's team), and walked away from the investigation. Ron recommends not wearing a wedding ring. The only social media presence he had was fake social identities. He puplicized information about what Facebook does behind the scenes and wrote an explanation on preventing Facebook from spying on our activities. When he got into a meeting with industry representatives, someone asked if everyone has a Facebook account, it was silent, and then asked for Facebook accounts with fake identities, and all the hands went up. 


One would not be able to find a photo of Ron online, except for one journalist who photographed him without his consent. We will meet a Canadian Cybersecurity specialist, Grant Thorton International. There are no digital records of him on the internet at all. He has a Linkedin account that he is using for something else, and he is not looking for a job. Generally, try to stay as anonymous as possible. It is very difficult. If we are beginning our assignment, he has placed some references of tips on completing the assignment. 

He has a great book on OSINT. It is 600 pages long. After it was published after August 2021, the makers of the software had to patch their applications to stop them from working. We can find photos that are not meant to be public from social media etc. 


We have a practice assignment of using Google Dorks/Search Engine hacks



Sometimes we have to show up and do a pentest, or social engineer our way into locations. Thus, it would be the worst idea to have a social media presence. Anonymity is a must, and one has to blend in. 

We should be invisible!


### The borders of the network 


They are not just in your network. It is wherever an employee is working! 

We have locations such as : 

	Head Office
	Home
	Satellite Office
	Hotel
	Coffeeshop


Such places as "Free Wireless Network", we should never do any sensitive work online. 

Devices prefer the strongest WIFI signal, and the device connects automatically to the last known WIFI network. With airports, the wireless access points tend to be on the ceilings, and the ceilings are quite high. If you sit somewhere close to someone, and you have a powerful transmitter with the same name, you can force all the clients to connect to YOUR network.

VPNs are a good idea, yet it is necessary to avoid any sensitive work online in those networks!


The only way to protect individuals is : 

	Training


If you can sit in a parking lot in a building, and someone is sitting by a window, and both are connected to a public wireless network (like Tim's or Macdonalds), and they have a WIFI network with the same name as the Macdonalds network, they can wreak havoc. 


###### WIFI


The length of a Tee shot in golf , aka 150 yards. The radio signal with a good antenna can pick up these signals as it boosts the reception. 


Wireless routers in a house can be accessed from 500 kms away. The antenna has to be STRONG. It is the antenna that is essential for reception. 


Wireless hacking is in the books : )


Someone asked about protecting WIFI access points ?

1. If you have a router with a matching WIFI network's name not connected to the internet could be placed there to prevent hackers from getting in the network due to the stronger signal. 
2. He tried running gaming systems through the electrical circuitry.


Most breaches are not caused by technical defencies.

They are due to : 

	Lack of Testing
	Bad Assumptions 
	Careless user activities (How many people go to a bar and leave their drinks unattended? These days, it is a bad idea. People leave their computers logged in all the time. He mentioned that he went into a lobby and noone was there, but the computer was logged in. The threat is not felt). Do not go to allyways in New Orleans --> malicious software. From Play Store, there was a compromised version of Jumping Birds (cant remeber the exact name).
	He mentioned connecting to a Bluetooth device from 1 km away.
							Users Way of Training - Multiple choice test with unlimited retries until one reaches 95%. There is no behavioural change at all. 



##### Examples in NS


1. A payroll server was accessible from the public wireless (with the name of the WIFI network in the lobby accessible from the parking lot, and admin passwords on the server was blank. It gave full administrative privileges. They NEVER tested the network
2. Public health data housed on a publically accessible FTP server inside the network's core
3. A city never managed their SCADA controller, which is connected to the internet, and the entity managing it were doing it through a PC with Windows NT with PCAnywhere running on it. There was a warning that it was not secure (PCAnywhere), It was outside the firewall


###### What needs to be done ?


We need to do the following :


1. Defense in Depth approach 
2. Diversified skills needs to be part of the team, and everyone is part of the defence team 
3. Everyone has to have a role
4. Culture in Security : raising levels of awareness, and making us a part of the culture : trust no one and trust that no computer is secured. He had one CEO mention after a considerable hack, and he worked with him on improving security, the CEO tried to pull out of this plan. 
5. Be prepared to face individuals who do not really care
6. Awareness
		1. He has been engaged to do a security operation, so what does he need to know ? 
					1. What assets do you have, and what needs protecting?
					2. What **threats** exist? 
					3. What **vulnerabilities** exist that threat actors might exploit?
						1. What is the **strategy** to deal with these threats?
							1. Acceptance : accepting the risk
							2. Avoidance : avoiding the risk completely 
							3. Transference : Transferring risk somewhere else  (a complex fast car with poor education could very well lead to a crash. Insurance : What is the price to transfer the risk to an insurance company? )
							4. Mitigation : is the most popular approach. We place things in motion to reduce the probability of the threat. 



### RISK MANAGEMENT


Risk = Probability X Impact 


What is the liklihood of something happening? and what aree the consequences? 


If the probability is extremely low, and the impact is extremely low , such as 



R = Pe(probability ) X  I for impact 

example 

0.1 X 0.4 = 0.4



He has another class that he gave an assignment for risks involving Shoppers Drug Mart : 


Theft
Insider theft
Loss of records
Someone stealing drugs



He likes the bridge example 


He is trying to cross the bridge, The threat that something that would lead him to falling into the water unto certain death

                           River


Asset      Threat     Vulnerability? a rotten board

ATV model of Risk 


You must have all three , or have no risk at all!



If you have the most valuable asset , and it is 100% secure, there is no risk. If you have the biggest assets , and no one cares about it , no risk. If you have no asset, you have no risk!


We spoke about mitigating the risk? we repair the board!


Cycle for risk management  to be asked ....



### System awareness

You can not protect what you can not understand!



"" I t is hard to interpret network fraffic so it is hard to determine if we have an problem 



He will show us two networks, with one with a botnet embedded in it. He will show us a map of the world, and pinpoint nodes around the world that are talking at this network. We have to tell him by looking at the map which network was hacked, and which had a bot in it? 


The map with the most red dots are botnets 






You can assume the attackers know the network better than I would 



He asked an old IT personnel to draw a network,  and he produced a very crude drawing of a network. The new ADMIN did know the network better. 



If you are a cop in a small town, the cop would know everyone , what they are doing , and understand their behaviour. This way, if something wrong happens, it leaps at you letting you know of its existence!

Learning the behaviour of each asset. Use data analytics!


Prepare ---> Detect ---> Respond!


### OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)


We can use publically available information 

We will be tasked with investigation a corporation . 


###### Search Operators 

If we are looking for Lilly Chalupowski

We can use "Lilly Chalupowski"

site option : 

site:amazon.com "Lilly Chalupowski"
site:remembrancesite.com "Lilly etc..."
site:nscc.ca


filetype option :

site:nscc.ca filetype:ppt
site:nscc.ca filetype:pop

(We would be amazed how much information we can find that is not meant to be public)


hyphen: 

good movies -romance
good movies -roamnce - sad -family -kids -comedy

inurl 

	inurl: "ftp://" (-inurl:http OR -inurl:https)

(Many people have public facing FTP server, mostly they do not know any better)


intitle :

	intitle:"organized cyber crime"
	allintitle: prganized cyber crime // no particular order of words
	intitle : "index of" Cyber

We should use indexes of pages!
