We are getting into the Nation-State phase . 




We need to start reading the major research. It has 200 pages. The individual's name is Carter Page. 



#### Carter Page


He had to deliver documents to his GRU handlers, so the GRU arranged for him to do a presentation at a university in Georgia. He was supposed to fly from the US with the documents. He arrived in Georgia and discovered he forgot the documents. 



The main motivation was to keep Hilary Clinton from being elected. Trump being elected is a bonus. The operation started two years before Trump was nominated. It was a full 3D intelligence operation : physical agewnts, compromised individuals in the US (some of them knew , and others did not : they thought they are a part of a specific movement, etc...). There was a massive Twitter Bot use. For a botnet, you would typically see ones with 20000 computers. The Hilary Clinton campaign was 100000. There was a botnet of 10000000. It was based out of Germany, and headed by a Russian. The cybergroup that controlled it would have agents everywhere. It was taken down because the ISP hosting it took it down for another reason (ISP was participant in cybercrime)



With the gold rush, those who made the best money were those selling shovels 


Mcolo : we want to make money not in hacking organizations, but providing tools technical support and everything you want to be the best hacker. Best cyber gangs is about setting up an infrastructure for cybercrime. There used to be throughout the former Soviet Union. Mcolo  wanted professionalism. When you hear of ransomware in North America, alot of the time it is not the suspected entity, but maybe you are a victim of someone who franchized their services. There was a person from Gatinou, QC, and he could be a franchizee of LockBit (a cyber gang). Lockbit takes a piece of what you earned. They get 30% and take care of it all. 


The less sophisticated versions of this were taken down. Mcolo ran his operations in Silicon Valley, California. He hired really qualified personnel to run this infrastructure. Alot of the biggest gang leaders (imagine the Godfather: all the heads of the families bringing their business to the OG. Godfather) if one botnet was caught and jailed, it would prevent many from continuing. This happened to Mcolo. Taking down the infrastructure prevented many attacks. 


#### Russian 2016 hack : 



CSIS warned about divisive messages online. 


GRU's campaign is to sow the seed of division in a country. 


two teams : 


Military intelligence / GRU 


Not too big in numbers, but the adversaries in Russia have access to everyone! If putin wanted to do an operation, the gang would have to accept or die. All support is given. prigozhin headed IRA (Internet Research Agency), and gained an entry to the private sector. The obligarchs paid for it. They used human intelligence. Immediately after the election was attacked, and after the discovery of activities, before power changed hands (on Jan. 6th), after these events, Obama gave a statement saying that they know why they did it, what they did and who they were. Ron mentioned that it was only one way it was possible : they had agents everywhere in Putin's circle. Key to what they do is based on a combination of 3D warface (4D land air sea and cyber) : identify adversaries (China, Russia, but people can redirect their internet connection ; accusations is made by validating with human intelligence).


prigozhin : They had a wide team of expert, they had the FSB, GRU, and everyone was asked to drop everything and were tasked with a mission : in order to tip the election in Trump's favour, they had to change 70000 votes in three states. In a country of 300000000 , that is not too many. How did they identify the 70000 people, and how did they change their votes? They thought "can they do a profile on everyone? " They had profiles of 200000000 Americans who can vote. Try to think of 5 things that uniquely describe you (age ? gender ? income ? education ? hobby?) , if he had 5 things about you like that , he can group us in groups, retailers online have 1500 profiles on you, so the ads are targeted towards you, and to convince you to buy what they sell. 


The GRU's team had 5000-7000 unique traits specific to 200 million voting americans. They can purchase it from data brokers (it is a legitimate way, but obviously not taken as it is too public, as well as being too expensive), so they entered a scheme to steal it. They wanted to contact Facebook, and to launch an app there like the quizes you see on Facebook (silly profiling). When you anwer the quiz, it is a bait in actuality. It could give them a lot of information. If you interact with it , you agree to give your data to the provider. The provider of the app can log in and retrieve the peoples' data. This team of IRA and GRU engaged a company from England called Cambridge Analytica, made of high end PHD level behaviour scientists, analyists. They can be hired to give useful information on the voters, if you are a marketing agency they would give the perfect profile for the target audience, and if you wished, they would design a campaign for you to push information to people. It would create certain impressions in them. They would do it via inserting information in search results, your social media experience, and so on. They are behaviour scientists that can feed you information that would cause a chain reaction in you towards a likely action. They would use facts to pull you in their desired direction. Many people do this for legitimate reasons. A political party can hire companies for influencing opinion on their competing political party, and would use the data to accomplish it. 



Internet information is there to manipulate you. Most of the time it is a company who wants you to buy their products. There have been experiements that ran to change someone's emotion : to make someone angry, sad, anxious, etc, and they would monitor your reactions to achieve their progress. They would want to know exactly what you are going through so they steer you into their goals. 


Cambridge Analytica had a side-husstle. If you wanted to win an electioni n a central African country, they would do it for you by arranging a scandal to a political oponent, bribing someone , or any other dirty tricks. They did it worldwide. The russians knew about them. The russians were not afraid to do anything for money. 


The app was launched on Facebook, and it gave them access (Cambridge ) to the people's data, who in turn , provided access to the russians



Halfway through the data download of all the voting people in the states they need the wins for, an engineer in facebook thought he was being hacked, the russians were downloading the data, and the russians told him that they have a financial agreement, so he turned the connection back on. 


What kind of things did they do ?


1. Start movements that convicne everyone tha tHilary clinton is the spawn of the devil.
2. They hired someone in Texas to build a fake jailcell with the images of hilary clinton to drive around Hilary's political campaigns, and was paid directly by the GRU (They pretended to be a political organization)
3. They picked gullible people with little education as their assets. They are doing personality profiles on the people they used. For example, in the wandering pickup truck jail , they knew he was like this. 



Hilary voters : they wanted them not to go to the polls. SO they put people on the ground to drive them to the wrong places or not show up. They had a phone campaign, and would tell callers who expected rides to tell them they are busy 

Trump supporters : they had a driver appear at your door. The data feed on you is being accessed 6-7 months before the event, and they mould whaty you see online to make you think Trump is the best ever. 

Bernie Sanders' supporters : the vote was stolen from him by Hilary supporters, and thus wanted Bernie's supporters to boycott the vote entirely. 


Some reports decided to pose as influencial people in an African country that have elections : 



Cabridge Analyytica Uncovered : Secret Filming reveals election tricks" on YouTube. 

1. Prepare to ruin oponents with honey traps (meet desired opposite sex in a compromising ways), secrets and spies (old-school tactics)
2. Alexander Niks -Online Marketing Rockstars event : They found data that would enable cabridge analytica to shift the vote in trump's favour. 
3. Campaigns are won by votes: placement of information is critical to influencing behaviour. They know who to target and what message to use to influence them.  Trump opponenets demanded the investigation of Cambridge Analytica, and how they hijacked democracy. 
4. They posed as a potential client in Sri Lanka : A fake politican meets analytica's representatives (major players in the company), the representatives mention that since you are collecting vast amounts of data they would use it to choose what message to choose , they advertised they had clients in Brazil, China etc. "Data extraction" : they have special partnerships with organizations that collect data. 
5. Another meeting : a London hotel, cambridge analytica reps : They discover unconcious fears by showing you something and then observing your reaction, so they owuld know that this topic causes this for you. They aim to go deeper in the subconcious mind. 
6. Kenyan elections : Analytica worked for Anyata : fake news spread over the internet by Analytica with videos smearing his openinets, by using popular fears such as health, poverty etc. analytica denied participation in such campaigns, but in private, they are proud of what they have done. "Rebranded the political party twice" and set up an entire political campaign. 
7. Digging dirt on political oponents:  "They have various intellifgence gathering organizations that collect information , and they have people from MI5 or MI6 or used to be". Subtlety is key! If someone was uncovered as propaganda,  it ruins their campaign. They may have to be contracting under a different name, different identity, so no record exists of their participation. "They have a code of conduct : no fake news , no lying , no entrapment "
8. CEO Alexander Nix agreed to meet : "largest political consultancy, we have established track record in the shadows, we look forwartd to a long-term secret relationship with you!". Alexander Nix : Actor asked how far they can go in terms of deep digging to find the deepest secrets : "we can speak to them, offer them a deal that is too stupid to be true , Offer bribe too good to be true: video them accepting it : ruin them by posting it online : send girls to their house to seduce them / such as porn stars etc". 
9. CEO Alexander Nix : They can operate an election under a vairty of guises : fake ids, websites for students attached to a university, tourists etc. Added secrecy : subc ontracting an ex-spy from an eastern european country, went into the country, did intelligence work, got out before anyone noticing. Analytica's contracted agencies would hire groups from UK Israel etc. .. 



Ron : The trump cmapign was the largest they have done. Analytica focused on Europe. The invasion of Ukraine was in 2015. They have been trying to destablise NATO. They mention who did not contribute to NATO fairly, etc.. Domestic groups are sayting too many immigrants coming from the Middle East and other places, your government is oppressing you : France, Germany Latvia, Lithuania, that push is still happening in these countries. Canadian government sent cyber specialists to Latvia in 2017. NATO can not respond in a unified fashion. This is what happened. When they tried to take Kiev 2 years ago and tried to overthrow the government, NATO responded and Putin was surprised. Putin's campaigns arte running in Africa, California, south america and other countries 
 #1 goal : our country for us , no trade agreements, our country is just for us so no immigrants, trade agreements are abuses, no to military or defence agreements, society has lost its traditional values. New things are happening due to government oversight. We need to stop them! There is a modern agenda that is against our belief systems ....   

1st event : 2019 federal election : took Canada by surprise. During the campaign. someone dropped a little thing in the water and it spread : all the disinfranchized people echoing something they heard from a campaign.  Ron has no political affiliations. Politicians are usually opportunistic. 

Scott Pryson -- decent honest politician.Ron went campaigning with him at church social events. 


TrudeuMustGo : GRU initiative , 5000 bots, 20000 people traded it back and forth. During that campaign, they ran pro pipeline groups and anti pipeline groups, pro climate change groups and anti climate change groups. They ran opposing teams! It was one of the reasons the campaign did not make much sense. It was geared to get people fighting each other. There is a long term objective.  Noone knows why they are attackinig Canada. 


Hilary Clinton embarrased putin publically on the world stage. He is not liberal, and wanted vengeance badly. Other objectives were achieved as well. There is a huge competition between China and russia in the African continent. China is building roads, hospitals etc in order to win the resources of the country as a thank you. Arctic regions are becoming a free for all!



China's motivation : Economic! How does this action make them money? In the trump campaign , China changed! they are major lenders to any government out there. Consider labour, manufacturing etc. They were happy to be the richest country. Suddenly, they started exhibiting military might in the south China sea. Motivation there : massive oil reserves in the South China sea. US, NATO etc have two fleets in the south China sea, and this never happened before, and the ships are two nuclear-equipped carriers. 

Watching two very clever guys fight with each other verbally, it is unpredicatble when one of them will land the initial strike. 


If the US became destablized, (he predicted ChatGPT in cars) China will invade Taiwan. The same thing (pre-2015) in the Ukraine, get them destablized to make the invasion easier. 


Some people in the US are saying "European War is a war in Europe. We should cut off weapons . We are poor and messed up as a country etc". These are political games. It goes beyond script kiddies. It is a new war front. Russia is pushing to be the biggest on the block and restablisgh the hold of the Soviet Union. China has traditionally been financially-motivated. They want to be an economic powerhouse in tghe world. In the last 5 years, they started producing aircraft carriers. 


Iran : Huge concern: Everything he mentioned about China doiing this in africa, Iran is doing this in the middle easter. If you ask someone in Gaza about Hamas, tthey mention social services. You ask the americans, they say it is a terrorist group. It is a fight for the middle east. In the arab spring, they were trying the social services motto (provide for the people, healthcare etc ).  It is a fight for power.


Biggest funder for the repuiblican party is a religious group that thinks that Israel must servive because it is wreitten the second coming is happening there. ALl the ailments of the US does not matter and Israel must exist. Iran must have the place for their saviour as well. The peolple benefiting from that are politicians (worse than usedcar dealers). How can I accomplish my agenda with your mess? 



North korea: We do not know why they do what they do.  In the border of north and south korea, they have 105 mm houser artilary, and all aimed towards south korea. They are set to launch at any time. If someone happened to the North korea leader, then they are prepared to destroy South Korea. Being able to hack a north korean missle is possible, but artillary is not hackable. China loves having them there. North korean cyber operations run from china. 



The two ships collided : cyber attack. They hacked the navigational systems


Russians is talking to North Korea to restock on arms. Canada is running low on small arms. The national reserves does not have much left.A lot was shipped to the Ukraine. 


To remember : the world is not what we think it is . When we speak the truth, people attach agendas to you. 


READ THE MOTHER REPORT 


The Project : Make sure is everyone on the team is going to contribute. Someone on the team could end up not working as hard. At the end of the project, we have to give a presentation. Ron has the ability to invite whomever he wants. If we have a weak link, it is a problem. The weak link : compassion understanding support assistance. If all that fails, speak to Ron
