

#### Mean Time to Detection :

		Number of days that they have root-level access for (...currently : 200 days)


Ex. If you stayed at a Marriott between 2013-2018, your information has been compromised 


> How was it discovered?


			One of the threat actors messed up while copying information from a compromised system to his own private system



How do we protect ourselves from an actual virus?


>Anti-Virus :
>We see a virus, we study it, we add its signature to our anti-virus database 



A new computer virus ---> 0-day Attack (brand new, it will work 100% until we figure out how to stop it)


#### How do we do our best ?


Each day of class, for every **1-hour of class time**, we need **2-hours of study time**



#### Exercise :


When I go home, sit down, and write down the names of your five closest associates (people seen once a month)



Under each name, write a note on how they came into your life (online, through a friend, at a bar etc...), where you have met them, etc ...


Do this for the rest of your life!


Hypothetically, if you are in charge of a major company's security, you would mention a new acquaintance who is too inquisitive



#### What we will do ?


If we grew in the countryside, we would learn how to hunt farm etc ...


If in the military, we would learn how to shoot (thus, as compared to learning how to hunt, they would properly show you how to hunt)


We will learn enough about networks to explore them and break their security, or the networks themselves


One student : he gained access to the data center, studied their wiring, built a system from scratch on a Raspberry PI, he buried it in their network, and got into a lot of trouble. 


We will learn ALOT about networks


We will learn a lot about operating systems


We will learn some programming


We will learn a LOT about scripting


We will not learn a lot about malware analysis


We will learn a lot about databases, enough to know how to build one, and how to break one


We will understand programming without becoming programmers. 


Cybercrime Survey ---> we learn about individual hackers, a lot about nation states, organized crime etc (how they do it, their motivations, their goals, skills etc ...)



First semestar ---> basics of IT , "He never lost a student because they never could do the technology". Highest loss is at the 2-months date from the beginning of the program (he lost them via burnout, they did not take it seriously, did not study for 2-hours for every hour spent in class, played video games all night , aka. did not take care of themselves. (less than 6-hours of sleep a night ---> concerntration and memory issues, high sugar/high fat diet ---> sugar takes away concentration, if you drink a Coke on Monday it takes until Thursday to recover)


People are toxic! Get rid of anything that would hinder your success story.


If you do not keep up, if you miss a few classes, do not do the homework, do other things, and you could not complete your first assignment, if you get embarrassed, you will stop going to classes. You need to communicate your issues with the instructor.


He will teach us how to develop new personas online, how to perform surveillance, etc ...


He was raised in a terrible neighbourhood full of criminals. You have to understand criminals so you can understand them. You need to understand vulnerabilities


**Situational Awareness** : A bubble all around you, as much as possible, start being aware of everything that happens inside this bubble. you can not thinking or talking, you have to observe and watch. You will spot threats and vulnerabilities. You will see patterns! Start practicing this today! Heightened levels of awareness is key!




#### Systems 


Windows System, capable of supporting lots of virtual machines. Main drive : SSD

Headphones/Microphone

WSL2 

1 250GB SSD

1-2 4TB drive


They will provide all the software :

Database : MySQL  (everything in the commandline)


Cybercrime course : Office Suite (writing + presentations) ---> We have to be able to teach others, and explain things to others to a non-technical audience.


Net172 Network (separate from the production network, separate password/same username, couple of weeks of strife)



If you have to miss a class : email him ( he will give us the opportunity to make up for it. He gets up before 4-5AM, he makes it here for 7 AM), pack a lunch. Do not buy lunch here.


Be ethical!


Remove apps that are not in use (apps watch you!)
