_Source: `Federal Rules of Evidence.md`_

**Purpose:** The codified statutes that govern evidence in US Federal Courts. _Daubert_ is essentially the Supreme Court's interpretation of **Rule 702**.

#### **Article VII: Opinions and Expert Testimony**

- **Rule 702 (Testimony by Expert Witnesses):**
    
    - A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion IF:
        
        - (a) The expert’s scientific/technical knowledge will help the trier of fact (jury) to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue;
            
        - (b) The testimony is based on **sufficient facts or data**;
            
        - (c) The testimony is the product of **reliable principles and methods**; and
            
        - (d) The expert has **reliably applied** the principles and methods to the facts of the case.
            

#### **Article VIII: Hearsay**

- **Rule 803(6) (Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity):**
    
    - _The "Business Records" Exception._
        
    - A record (memorandum, report, data compilation) is **not hearsay** (and thus admissible) if:
        
        - (A) the record was made at or near the time by — or from information transmitted by — someone with knowledge;
            
        - (B) the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business;
            
        - (C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity.
            
    - _Forensic Note:_ This allows server logs, access logs, and automated reports to be admitted without calling the server administrator to the stand.
        

#### **Article IX: Authentication**

- **Rule 901 (Authenticating or Identifying Evidence):**
    
    - **General Rule:** The proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.
        
    - **Rule 901(b)(9) (Evidence About a Process or System):** Evidence describing a process or system and showing that it produces an accurate result.
        
    - _Forensic Note:_ This is how you prove a digital file is authentic. You describe the hashing process (MD5/SHA1) and show the hashes match.
        

#### **Article X: Contents of Writings & Recordings**

- **Rule 1001 (Definitions):**
    
    - "Writings" and "recordings" include letters, words, or numbers set down in any form (including magnetic, mechanical, or electronic).
        
- **Rule 1001(d) (Original):** For electronically stored information, "original" means any **printout** — or other output readable by sight — if it accurately reflects the information.
    
- **Rule 1002 (Requirement of the Original):** An original writing, recording, or photograph is required to prove its content unless these rules provide otherwise.
