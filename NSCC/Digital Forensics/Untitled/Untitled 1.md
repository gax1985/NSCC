### **Document 2: The Frye Standard (Comprehensive Analysis)**

_Source: `Frye Standard.md`_

**Purpose:** This is the historical baseline for scientific evidence. While largely replaced, it is the "origin story" of forensic admissibility and is still used in some US states (e.g., California, New York, Pennsylvania).

#### **1. The Case Origin**

- **Case Name:** _Frye v. United States_ (293 F. 1013, D.C. Cir. 1923).
    
- **The Facts:** A defendant (Frye) was accused of murder. He tried to use a "Systolic Blood Pressure Deception Test" (a very early, crude lie detector) to prove he was telling the truth when he denied the crime.
    
- **The Ruling:** The court **rejected** the evidence. The conviction stood.
    

#### **2. The Core Rule: "General Acceptance"**

- **The Quote:** The court stated that for a scientific principle to be admissible, _"the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained **general acceptance** in the particular field in which it belongs."_
    
- **The Methodology:**
    
    - The court looks to the "relevant scientific community."
        
    - It acts as a consensus-taker. If the majority of scientists in that field say "Yes, this works," the evidence is admitted.
        
    - If the technique is experimental, controversial, or used by only a few experts, it is rejected.
        

#### **3. The "Conservative" Nature**

- **Pros:** It keeps "junk science" and "snake oil" out of the courtroom. It prevents juries from being dazzled by fake experts using impressive-sounding but unproven gadgets.
    
- **Cons:** It is notoriously slow.
    
    - _Example:_ Fingerprinting, DNA profiling, and digital forensics were all initially rejected under _Frye_ because they were too new to be "generally accepted" at the time.
        
    - _The "Innovation Lag":_ Reliable technology is often excluded simply because it is new.
        

#### **Definitions Section (Frye Context)**

|**Term**|**Definition (Frye Context)**|
|---|---|
|**General Acceptance**|The standard requiring that a method be recognized by a significant majority of experts in the relevant field.|
|**Relevant Scientific Community**|The specific group of experts (e.g., "Digital Forensic Analysts") whose opinion matters for the test.|
|**Admissibility**|The legal quality of being allowed to be presented to the judge/jury.|
