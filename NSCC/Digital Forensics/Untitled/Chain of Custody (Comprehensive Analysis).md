### **Document 6: Chain of Custody (Comprehensive Analysis)**

_Source: `Sample-Chain-of-Custody-Form (1).docx`_

**Purpose:** The definitive log of evidence integrity.

#### **Critical Fields Breakdown**

- **Header Information:**
    
    - **Case Number:** Links the physical item to the legal case file.
        
    - **Submitting Officer:** The person who originally seized the item.
        
    - **Location of Seizure:** Must be precise (e.g., "North Bedroom, Under Mattress" vs "House").
        
- **Item Description:**
    
    - **Quantity:** (e.g., "1").
        
    - **Description:** Must include **Make, Model, and Serial Number**.
        
    - _Why:_ To prove _Identity_. "A Black iPhone" is not unique. "iPhone 13, Serial # F12L900" is unique.
        
- **Chain of Custody Log (The Grid):**
    
    - **Date/Time:** The exact moment of transfer.
        
    - **Released By:** Signature of the current custodian.
        
    - **Received By:** Signature of the new custodian.
        
    - **Purpose:** (e.g., "Transport to Lab," "Analysis," "Storage").
        
    - _The Rule:_ There must be **no gaps**. If Officer A releases at 12:00 and Officer B receives at 14:00, the evidence is legally compromised (Where was it for 2 hours?).
        
- **Final Disposal:**
    
    - **Authority:** Who authorized the destruction or return?
        
    - **Witness:** A second person must verify that the item was actually destroyed (to prevent theft/corruption).
