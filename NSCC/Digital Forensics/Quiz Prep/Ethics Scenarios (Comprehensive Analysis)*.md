### **Document 5: Ethics Scenarios (Comprehensive Analysis)**

_Source: `Ethics Scenarios _ UK Cyber Security Council.md`_

**Purpose:** Practical application of ethical codes to real-world dilemmas.

#### **Scenario A: Professional Competence**

- **Situation:** A client asks a general security consultant to perform a specialized forensic investigation. The consultant needs the money but lacks the training.
    
- **Ethical Principle:** **Competence / Professional Integrity.**
    
- **Analysis:** Accepting the work risks damaging the evidence due to lack of skill (e.g., failing to use a write-blocker). It also harms the client (who gets a bad investigation) and the profession (reputation damage).
    
- **Correct Action:** Decline the assignment or partner with a qualified expert.
    

#### **Scenario B: Conflict of Interest**

- **Situation:** During an investigation, the analyst discovers the suspect is a personal friend or family member.
    
- **Ethical Principle:** **Objectivity / Impartiality.**
    
- **Analysis:** Personal feelings (loyalty, love) inevitably cloud professional judgment. Even if the analyst is 100% fair, the _perception_ of bias will allow the defense attorney to destroy the analyst's credibility in court.
    
- **Correct Action:** Immediate recusal. Hand the case to another investigator.
    

#### **Scenario C: Scope of Authority (The "Plain View" Doctrine)**

- **Situation:** An analyst has a warrant to search for financial fraud (documents/spreadsheets). While searching, they find a folder containing Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).
    
- **Ethical Principle:** **Compliance with Law / Protecting Society.**
    
- **Analysis:** The analyst has a duty to report the CSAM (Protect Society). However, they have no legal authority to search for it (Warrant Scope). Continuing to search might make the new evidence inadmissible ("Fruit of the Poisonous Tree").
    
- **Correct Action:** Stop the search immediately. Secure the device. Report the finding to the appropriate authority to obtain an expanded warrant.
