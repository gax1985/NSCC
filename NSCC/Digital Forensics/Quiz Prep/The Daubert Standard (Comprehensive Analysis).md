### **Document 3: The Daubert Standard (Comprehensive Analysis)**

_Source: `Daubert Standard _ Legal Information Institute.md`_

**Purpose:** This is the current, dominant standard in US Federal Courts (and widely influential in Canada). It shifts power from the "scientific community" to the "Trial Judge."

#### **1. The Case Origin**

- **Case Name:** _Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc._ (509 U.S. 579, 1993).
    
- **The Facts:** Two children were born with serious birth defects. They sued Merrell Dow, claiming the drug Bendectin caused it. Their experts used animal studies and re-calculated data that had _not_ been published or peer-reviewed.
    
- **The Conflict:** Under _Frye_, this evidence was inadmissible (not generally accepted). The Supreme Court took the case to update the law.
    
- **The Ruling:** The Court ruled that the _Federal Rules of Evidence_ (Rule 702) superseded _Frye_. The "General Acceptance" test was too rigid.
    

#### **2. The Core Rule: "The Gatekeeper"**

- **The Shift:** The Trial Judge is now the **"Gatekeeper."**
    
- **The Responsibility:** The judge must ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence is not only relevant but **reliable**.
    
- **The "Scientific Method" Focus:** The judge doesn't ask "Is this popular?" They ask "Is this **valid science**?"
    

#### **3. The 5 Factors (The Admissibility Checklist)**

_Note: These are flexible. You don't need all 5, but you need enough to convince the judge._

1. **Testing (Falsifiability):**
    
    - Can the theory or technique be tested? Has it been tested?
        
    - _Forensic Detail:_ If you use a tool like "Autopsy," can you verify it finds deleted files correctly? Yes.
        
2. **Peer Review and Publication:**
    
    - Has the theory been subjected to peer review?
        
    - _Forensic Detail:_ While some proprietary tools (like Cellebrite) keep their code secret, the _methodology_ of mobile extraction is widely discussed in journals.
        
3. **Error Rate:**
    
    - What is the known or potential rate of error?
        
    - _Forensic Detail:_ Does the facial recognition match fail 5% of the time? The court needs to know.
        
4. **Standards and Controls:**
    
    - Are there standards controlling the technique's operation?
        
    - _Forensic Detail:_ Did you use a write-blocker? Did you follow NIST guidelines? Did you validate your hash sums?
        
5. **General Acceptance:**
    
    - Is it generally accepted?
        
    - _Detail:_ This is the old _Frye_ standard. It is now just one of five factors, not the only one.
        

#### **4. The "Daubert Trilogy" (Expansion Cases)**

- **General Electric Co. v. Joiner (1997):** Established that appellate courts generally defer to the trial judge's decision unless there is a clear "abuse of discretion." The Gatekeeper is powerful.
    
- **Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael (1999):** Extended _Daubert_ to **non-scientific** experts (e.g., engineers, mechanics, skilled technicians).
    
    - _Relevance:_ Even if you argue digital forensics is a "technical trade" and not a "science," you still have to pass the Daubert test.
        

#### **Definitions Section (Daubert Context)**

|**Term**|**Definition (Daubert Context)**|
|---|---|
|**Gatekeeper**|The role of the Trial Judge to screen evidence for reliability before the jury sees it.|
|**Falsifiability**|The inherent possibility that a hypothesis can be proven false. A key mark of the Scientific Method.|
|**Peer Review**|The evaluation of work by one or more people with similar competencies (peers) to the producers of the work.|
|**Error Rate**|The statistical frequency with which a method produces an incorrect result (False Positive/False Negative).|
