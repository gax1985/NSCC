*Source*: `Canada Evidence Act.md`

>**Purpose:** This Act acts as the master filter for the Canadian federal justice system. It dictates what information is allowed to enter the courtroom ?("Admissibility") and who is allowed to speak ("Competence").

#### **Part 1: The Witnesses (Competency & Privilege)**

* **Application (Section 2):**
* This law applies to **all** criminal and civil proceedings under federal jurisdiction (e.g., Criminal Code offenses, Narcotics, Income Tax). It does *not* apply to purely provincial matters (like a speeding ticket), which have their own provincial evidence acts.


* **Competency of Interest (Section 3):**
* *The Old Rule:* Historically, if you had a financial interest in the case or a criminal record, you were banned from testifying.
* *The CEA Rule:* That ban is abolished. A person with a criminal record or a vested interest **is competent** to testify. Their history might affect their *credibility* (how much the jury believes them), but not their *eligibility* to speak.


* **Spousal Privilege (Section 4):**
* **The Accused:** You are always allowed to testify in your own defense.
* **The Spouse (General Rule):** The husband/wife of the accused is a competent witness for the defense.
* **The Spouse (Prosecution):** A spouse is generally *not* compellable (cannot be forced) to testify against their partner.
* **Communications Privilege (S. 4(3)):** A husband/wife cannot be forced to reveal any communication made to them by their spouse during the marriage. This protects the sanctity of marital privacy.


* **Incriminating Questions (Section 5):**
* *The Scenario:* A witness is asked: "Did you help the hacker hide the drive?"
* *The Fear:* If they say "Yes," they confess to a crime. If they refuse to answer, they are in Contempt of Court.
* *The CEA Solution:* The witness **MUST answer**. However, the answer receives "Use Immunity." It cannot be used to prosecute *them* in a future case (unless they lie under oath, which is perjury).


* **Disability Accommodations (Section 6):**
* If a witness has a mental or physical disability preventing clear speech, they can testify via any means that make their evidence intelligible (writing, signs, gestures). This testimony has the same legal weight as spoken words.



#### **Part 2: Expert Witnesses (Quantity Control)**

* **The "Five Expert" Cap (Section 7):**
* *The Rule:* "No more than five of such witnesses may be called upon either side without the leave of the court."
* *The Detail:* This prevents "Expert Shopping" or overwhelming the jury with 20 repetitive experts. If you need a Forensic Pathologist, a Ballistics Expert, a DNA Expert, a Digital Forensic Analyst, and a Psychologist, you have used your 5 slots.
* *The Loophole:* You can ask the judge for "Leave" (permission) to call more, but you must ask *before* the trial starts or right when the evidence arises.



#### **Part 3: Verification of Evidence**

* **Handwriting Comparison (Section 8):**
* Comparison of a disputed writing with any writing proved to the satisfaction of the court to be genuine shall be permitted to be made by witnesses.
* *Forensic Application:* This is not just for handwriting. It sets the precedent for "Pattern Matching" disciplines.


* **Oaths & Affirmations (Section 13-14):**
* **Oath:** Swearing on a religious text creates a moral obligation to tell the truth based on divine judgement.
* **Affirmation:** A solemn, non-religious declaration.
* *Section 14(2):* If a person affirms, their evidence is taken exactly as if they had taken an oath.


* **Judicial Notice (Sections 17-18):**
* The court takes "Judicial Notice" of all Acts of Parliament (Imperial, Federal, and Provincial). You do not need to prove the law exists; the judge is presumed to know it.



#### **Part 4: Documentary Evidence (Paper Records)**

* **Official Documents (Sections 19-22):**
* Copies of Proclamations, Treaties, and Governor General Orders are admissible if they purport to be printed by the **King's Printer** (Official Printer).


* **Court Records (Section 23):**
* You prove a previous conviction/acquittal by submitting a certified copy of the indictment/conviction signed by the Clerk of the Court. You do not need the Clerk to come testify.



#### **Part 5: Specialized Evidence (The Forensic Core)**

**A. Financial Institutions (Section 29)**

* *Why it exists:* To prevent disruption of the banking system. We cannot seize a bank's servers for every fraud trial.
* **The Admissibility Rule (S. 29(1)):** A copy of any entry in a financial book/record is **prima facie evidence** (accepted as true on its face) of the entry and the matters/transactions recorded.
* **The Conditions (S. 29(2)):** You must prove:
1. The book was one of the ordinary books of the bank.
2. The entry was made in the usual and ordinary course of business.
3. The book is in the custody/control of the financial institution.
4. The copy is a true copy (verified by affidavit).


* **Search & Seizure (S. 29(7)):** A warrant to search a bank is only granted if the bank *itself* is the suspect, or under special circumstances.

**B. Business Records (Section 30)**

* *Why it exists:* To solve the "Hearsay" problem for corporate data.
* **The Rule (S. 30(1)):** A record made in the "usual and ordinary course of business" is admissible.
* **The "Investigation" Exclusion (S. 30(10)):** This is the most critical detail. "Nothing in this section renders admissible a record made in the course of an investigation or inquiry."
* *Detail:* If a System Admin writes a report *about* the hack, that is an investigation record (Inadmissible under s.30). If the System Admin pulls the *automated* server logs that run every day, that is a business record (Admissible).



**C. Electronic Documents (Sections 31.1 - 31.8)**

* **The Burden of Proof (S. 31.1):** The person seeking to admit the electronic document must prove its **Authenticity**.
* **The Threshold:** The burden is met by providing "evidence capable of supporting a finding that the electronic document is that which it is purported to be."
* **Best Evidence Rule (S. 31.2):** An electronic printout is acceptable as the "best evidence" if the system was functioning properly.
* **Presumption of Integrity (S. 31.3):** The court presumes the system is reliable if:
* (a) The system was operating properly at all material times.
* (b) Any malfunction did not affect the integrity of the document.


* **Standards (S. 31.4):** The Crown can offer evidence that the system met established security standards (like ISO 27001) to support the presumption of integrity.

#### **Part 6: Public Interest (Secrecy)**

* **Section 37:** A Minister or official can object to disclosing information. The judge acts as a referee, weighing the "Public Interest in Secrecy" vs. "The Accused's Right to a Defense."
* **Section 38:** Focuses on International Relations and National Defense.
* **Section 39:** Cabinet Confidences (What the Prime Minister discusses with Ministers) are absolutely protected.
