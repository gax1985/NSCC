# Sock Puppet How-To


1. Character needs all the components of a real like online account : 
   
   - Past history
   - Set of Beliefs
   - Friends
   - Comments
   - Mentions from around the internet
   
   >[!note]
   > Make yourself a business person who does not know *anything* about the technology that the target is involved in. That enables you to use the same Sock Puppet account for multiple targets in a particular field

A previous student posed as a widower, and endless people sent him anniversary messages.

2. Sock Puppet must have *no connection* to you:
   People have made mistakes involving the assignment, such as logging in to the account without a VPN. Social media has gotten really good at automatic detection of suspicious activity. You should have different equipment for Sock Puppet accounts, where you would have a machine built for this purpose. All the associated equipment should *never* be associated back to you. Do not provide them with your NS phone number. Get a *Mint SIM Card*. You can get phony phone numbers. There is a whole industry out there to support anonymity online. Professionally, you want a phone that is maintained until you switch phones. The adversaries are better than you. If the character is supposed to be in Vancouver, and if you happen to visit Vancouver, buy a burner phone. Everything you do leaves a footprint. Pay in cash, or use pre-paid credit cards. Think about the installed applications. You do not want to use any browser that has tracking capabilities. There are browsers written specifically for that. There are versions of Linux that leave no digital fingerprint on the machine or elsewhere. There are a lot of tools that enables the person to detect whether someone is investigating their machine. Use a VPN after establishing a social media account, but you do not want it to be traced back to you. Go to a public space, such as a hotel, restaurant, cafe and so on. Use Incognito browsing. After setting up the account, you are never to interact with the account without using a VPN. You want a bullet proof VPN, where it does not log *any activity*. You would want it to be outside of the jurisdiction where you are working, such as avoiding five-eyes countries. There is an arguement for staying out of the seven-eyes countries. You are not safe from american intelligence. They are in most VPN providers that are not logging, as insiders can exfiltrate information at will. If you use mobile data from a burner phone not traceable back to you or your location. Using AWS , which is an american service, causes concern.

>Use an email address from a provider outside of the five-eyes countries. You would want an email address where it provides encryption capabilities, and it is from a bulletproof provider.

>Due to russian activies, the US government demanded from Social Media platforms to mandate the requirement for a real photo -> **THIS PERSON DOES NOT EXIST service**. You may need more than just a profile picture. A student whose online sock puppet is currently travelling around the world. She had a friend going through Germany and other countries in Europe. Her friend would send her her photos, photos of tickets for events, and so on.  

2. Maintain the accounts :
   
   Do not be afraid to maintain them. 
   
   >[!important]
   >
   >In the real world, maintain sock puppet account histories for the past two years. 
   
2. You must have friends -> If the connections between multiple sock-puppet accounts are believable, then it is a great idea. You can add random people online. Avoid buying followers, as their sock-puppet accounts can be traceable. Also, the payment for this service could be traceable, or the person who provides the service could make an error of judgement. If you can have a friend in the industry that you are targeting, befriend them. 
3. Avoid duplicate data between sock puppets.
4. Avoid wrong time zone data.
5. Avoid wrong geo-location data.
6. Avoid wrong comments about the weather or the time of the day, such as "what a storm" when the sock puppet is supposed to be in California. 
7. Linguistic Analysis -> write the message/post you want to write, and ask the generative AI to replicate that as "... a 60-year old man who has little education, and raised in Kentucky".
