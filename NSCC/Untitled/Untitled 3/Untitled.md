ROles and duties :

  

first responders --> Law enforcement 1st responsibility -> secure the scene , Ron's daughter was a paramedic and she had to go there as a first responder and she wont enter the scene until police goes in and secure the place. You can go into an active crime scene, or executing a warrant. They ned to secure the scene : rest of the crew and the public should be safe and secure. First responders identify the witnesses, victims and initial suspects. In the case of an active crime scene, it could be chaotic. They have to bring things under control, and they need to establish a barrier. This is true for active crime scene or execution of warrants. The crime scene tape as a cultural context is a communication method to not go past the tape. If you think back to the physical security, it gives you a perimeter to exercise control over. You do this to protect the scene for forensic purposes. We are protecting against any material evidence located inside the crime scene, like footprints, fingerprints, fiber etc. The key is to preserve the state of the scene so nothing can be introduced. Suspects leave something behind when they come in to the crime scene and leave something behind. Role of the first responders is to preserve the scene from contamination. They are usually constables or police officers. There have been thousands of cases where an untrained constable goes in and accidently contaminate evidece. In terms of phone technology, poorly trained individuals will do actions like turn this on and off, try to pass pin codes, and so on. It is critical that mobile devices be preserved. Something as simple as pressing a keyboard or clicking on a mouse will leave evidence on the computer that contaminated. For example, there was a real case where someone was killed. A forensic investigator determined that after the guy died, the dead person tried to log in.   

investigators --> detectives. They determine where the scene was contaminated. First responders may not always be truthful. Evidence of tampering may appear way later. They need to make sure documentation of evidence is done properly. They insure the chain of custody is started. We are responsible for starting it.  
  
  
crime technician --> You. They can be sworn or unsworn. By far, 80:20 unsworn:sworn. You are responsible for all associated documentation. It includes photographs. A technician would photograph the evidence items before beginning the process. They document every step, and there can not be any chance to the environment that is not thoroughly documented. Regardless of criminal or corporate investigation, the evidence will be presented to the judge and the jury ( for evaluation ). Defence council will challenge you all the way. They will go through every step in the item and criticizing it. Having a full video of the crime scene is a great start. Identification and position of the item at the scene is a good idea.  
  
Action at the scene might involve Volatile Memory Capture. If you have a device in the room, prior to working with the device, make sure the power is not shut off. You need to capture an image of the running memory. If you are standing infront of a powered on computer, it is relatively simple. If the computer is located at a distance from you, there are tools for that. If there is a vm in the cloud, you need to capture an image of the running memory of the VM. There was a development of a new tool, where you could use Covert Agents on the machine prior to the collection, and then you can engage it to give you a running image of the RAM. It has to be capable of any situation. If you are in the middle of incident response situation on the cloud, if you placed it in advance, you can signal the the agent to capture the image of the running RAM.  
  
Bag and tag the evidence. Every evidence item has to have a tag on it, place it in a recipticle in an evidence locker or a bag or a box to seal it from the outside world. As you are doing this collection of evidence, you have to be aware of allowed search and seizure protocols of the event you are investigating. You need probbale cause, and without it , the case would be dismissed before the trial. a Probable Cause hearing happens before a judge. They listen to what was done, where they mention the officer done something to cause an arrest. The judge will consider whether probable cause is in place. There is a possibility you are operating within a warrant. Warrants are specific to what you can search and what you can take. If you are searching in a domicile, and the computer is in the garage, and the warrant does not permit going into side buildings, it gets thrown out. You can inquire with the person who owns the property, and they could give you consent. If that happens, you are permitted to go in and take evidence, but this person can withdraw their consent.


## Bagging and Tagging Evidence


The fact is that it is evidence gets you a *case number*. In Security Onion, you can have a case number in the software. It would have date time, description of the item, who collected it, and where it was located. 



# Corporate Investigations


They are a different case. You *do not need a search warrant*. As long as you have permission of the corporation, you can go ahead. If the person inside this corporation has a personal laptop, then you are not allowed to seize it. Everything we talked about is all about **Sound Collection of Evidence**. If you are doing a corporate investigation, you have to make sure everything you collect is **forensically sound**. You could be required to testify in a civil case. You could be back in court if the person is suing the company. If you found porn on the laptop, it is legal. The person can get fired, but they can go back and sue the company saying that there was no porn on their machine. The council will be all over you to pick on your collection of evidence. Document every step. Do everything you would do normally, except you do not need a warrant. 

If someone is cooking the books, you go to the CEO. If you open someone's computer, and there is child pornography, call the police right away. If you do not, you could be charged with conspiracy. You would do everything you can do to have a *forensically sound investigation*. If the personal computer is there, it can not be taken, but make sure it does not leave the scene. If they go and take it, call the police, and mention they are taking evidence. If it is a company laptop, you take it right away. 

For Corporate Espionage, If you have a white-collar crime, you speak to the company.You would call the police immediately if there is evidence of possible harm. 


## Electronic Documents (*in the law)


They include logs and other items, and the law can categorize a variety of items. If someone is selling weed at the house, everything in that house could be evidence. Electronic devices in that house would be collected. If someone collected a hard drive at the scene of the crime, they are so backlogged that it will take them a year and a half. Sometimes, if it takes longer, it could dismiss the trial due to the period of time. You have to be aware of the *domain you are working in (province, country state, particular industry like a hospital* and the *legaslation affecting that domain*. If you are doing IT Security in a hospital, you have to know all the rules and laws that govern your behavior. Coming into that is the same as knowing how to configure OS permissions. It is part of the same skillset, and if you do not, it would not classify you as a professional or *skilled in the art*, and you will be held at that standard. If someone does not have access legally, you can not claim ignorance. Make yourself aware. 

## What to collect at the scene ...
Any electronic devices, like phones , computers, social media platforms, printouts that(considered part of the evidence of the electronic device). You will collect everything digital, any dongles like secure factor authentication, etc. If you are signing kernel code, the signing process will look for a dongle. Take all the chargers, cables and peripherals. Chargers and cables are bagged and tagged. Peripherals will include anything from external harddrives to printers. The latter may have latent memory , so you have to do a live memory capture before it is shut off. You have to prove that someone printed it. Capture the buffer of the printer to know who printed what. Grab the manuals for every device, and it is part of your evidence. You will gather things you neever worked with before. 


### Farady Bags

Drug dealers will have a prior agreement with an outside person to remotely access the device remotely and wipe it. Place it immediately in the Farady Bag to block electromagnetic signals. They do not always work, and you get what you paid for. Some constables stuck a cellphone in a standard Farady Bag and the phone started ringing. The Tech Crime Lab in Dartmouth has an entire room that acts as a Farady Cage. They have a tent in the room with the devices they collected, and all the tools they need to work with the device. 


### Evidence Locker


It is traditionally a locked cabinet. It may be fire resistant, Farady Cage, water resistant and so on. If you are gathering devices like hard drives , you place them in a cabinet or container or room that is secured. If you have digital files, you have software that acts like an Evidence Cabinet. It is locked by you and you are the only one that has access. Those evolved from Digital Lockers to Digital Evidence Management Systems. They include the digital storage where you place the files, and you have digital logging software to manage access to digital evidence.

# Rules of Collection of Evidence


They are different based on Jurisdiction


## Canada Evidence Collection Act 


Talks about **Expert Witness** in our case, where you would have to explain to the jury all the information about the digital forensic evidence. 

1. Being an Expert Witness can be on the prosecution or defense, where the latter can make more money. 

2. Either side can request a maximum of *four witnesses* in Canada, and maybe five in the US.


3. Any witness is called a **Lay Witness**. There is a difference between **Competence**, where you have to be an expert of the field, and **Credibility**, where what you say could be challenged. You can destry your own credibility by saying or doing the wrong thing on the stand. 
4. There are rules governing **Expert Witness** in Canada, and we have an example case involving Supreme Case ruling where the **Trial Court** is the place where the case is first presented, and you can go to **Appeal Court**. Admissibility of evidence is determined by Trial Court. The case is about a doctor who sexually abused the patients, and a psychiatrist was called to the stand and their testimony got destroyed. 
5. Evidence must be relavent to the case
6. It must be a necessity for the Trier of Fact : a judge, jury and so on. It must be necessary to have the evidence to arrive at a decision.
7. Before you testify there may be a *VoireDu*, where they mention who is testifying and what they will say. The judge can decide there where the testimony is applicable. They would ask themselves if they could reach a decision with it. 
8. Exclusionary Rule : Fruit of a Poisoned Tree : You got evidence in an illegal manner. You found evidence but did not have a warrant, or the location was not covered by the warrant, you coerced someone to give evidence and so on. It does not matter if the evidence is damning, the **Fruit of the Poisoned Tree** makes it inadmissible. You might follow them online , wiretap their house or check their phone from an overseas trip, and you may get new evidence, but you can not use the old evidence. Thailand is a suspicious place for obvious reasons, where people are searched routinely when they get back.
9. As long as there is no exclusionary rule, you have to be a **Qualified Expert**. If you mention you studied here you may not pass, but if you have specific degrees in this field, or certifications (DFIR - the best forensic investigator in Canada has an IT certificate from NSCC. He teaches at the police college. His only training is a diploma in IT, owrked in the RCMP, did multiple certifications and 20 years of digital forensics experience. He is indeed an expert). You need provable experience to be a **Qualified Expert**. If you have studied it, but have no experience, the evidence will be presented, but you will be challenged. Experience is very high on the list. When defending his thesis, an examiner cross-examined Ron's points. 
10. If you discover criminal embezzlement, and you report them, this person can sue you. You could be presented as a witness in the case as compared to expert witness

## US Standards


### Federal Rules of Evidence

States od not have to use them. It is the fall back for states. It used to be 

t
#### Fry Standard

1. Are they a recognized professional?
2. Is their methodology good? 
3. Do they have their certifications ? 

That went away. Someone tried to use a lie detector in the prosecution. All the physical signs that someone is lying, and someone testified that someone is lying, and the judge decided to check if the methodology is sound, and there was doubt the physiological response is due to stress instead of lying. That is where the Fry Standard came from. You have to be a qualified expert, and you have to demonstrate that the methodology used is the industry standard. It still can be used, but most courts/prosecutions can use it/. 


They fall back on ...


### Dobart Standard
Against a pharmaceuticals company. Admissibility is due to the judge :

1. Technique has been tested repeatedly  to reproduce the same result
2. Publicized and Peer Reviewed
3. Potential Error rate (90% of the time? It is up to the trail court to decide)
4. Has it gained wide acceptance in the field, where everyone is in agreement.



### Article 10 : contents of recording of artifacts in the US. 
It governs our practice. 

Article 8 comes in play. It is the **Heresay Finding**. If you can not prove that digital evidence you are presenting has not been changed or manipulated through misunderstanding chain of custody, they consider it heresy. You would have the physical hard drive in the physical cabinet, and make an image and get the hash of the image. 


## Chain of Custody
Governeing philosophy for incident response, corporate or criminal investigations : 

1. Everything has to be **forensically sound** --> **Chain of Custody** --> Who has it, where it is, and you are the only one who has the ability to access it. 
2. Prove that it has not been tampered with. You do it digitally with multiple hashes, and demonstrate when you pick it up by hashing it again and comparing it. 
3. It has to be documented. In readings, we have the supreme court as well as all the points on bright space. We have an example chain of custody form. It include a lot of information. You can use any indicators that can identify the device. Describe everything extensively. 
4. The item is in the evidence locker. Someone comes along, like a forensic analyst, the image of the harddrive is in the digital evidence locker. They have been awarded discovery by the court. You transfer the image to the defense council, and everything has to be documented for the transfer. Anyone who has had possession of it without our supervision, this has to be documented. If someone is standing behind you, the evidence can not be left alone with anyone else. If you had to go to the bathroom, lock the evidence, lock the room and make sure no one is alone with it with direct access.

#### Forensic Bridge (in February Disk Forensics)


Used for copying an image from the hard drive. If you copy from the hard drive, you contaminate evidence. If you look at the hard drive, you also tamper with evidence. The Forensic Bridge makes it possible for the computer to read the drive, and guarantees that you can not physically write anything to the hard drive. This is something you should have in your kit bag. If you have to do Incident Response or Forensics for a company, this will be part of your kit. There are software equivalents, but they can not be trusted, and your evidence will be challenged thoroughly. He might be able to show us what the documentation looks like. He might ask us to evaluate tools, and ask us to try them out.
