Digital Forensics Course Outline  
Rational  
The techniques of Digital Forensics are frequently applied in Cyber Security. This may involve  
conducting post-incident investigations, gathering evidence for on-going investigations or preparing  
evidence for trial. It is important that a Cyber Security professional be aware of proper forensic  
techniques to gather data and maintain the integrity of evidence.  
Description  
This course introduces the student to the practice of Digital Forensics as it is applied in Cyber  
Security. Techniques and tools studied include Memory Forensics, Disk Forensics and Mobile  
Device Forensics. Professional practices reviewed include Chain of Custody, non-repudiation  
techniques and tools, and preparing evidence for trial. This course also presents an overview of  
privacy law and ethical practice as they apply to Digital Forensics. Various techniques and tools  
used in the collection, identification, analysis and reporting of evidence are discussed.
