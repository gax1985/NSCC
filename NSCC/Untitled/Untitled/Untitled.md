The focus of the course will be doing hands-on Digital Forensics. This is a brand new course. 

We will have a hands-on technical components of the assignment, as well as competency tests. 

We will get into Disk Forensics in the next section. Following that, we will have Memory Forensics.

Ethical Practices
Evidence Handling 


# Ethics 


There are so many philosophical practices in connection to ethics. This is a results of the mission of those who involve themselves in ethics of keeping ethical thought current. 


## Normative Ethics 


#### Consequenialism

It is expressed by saying "**The ethics of a situation is determined by its *outcomes***".

If you are launching a product in a market, costs vs benefits analytics, and other means of measurable analysis of outcomes would be utilised to choose a path. 

>[!example]
>
>What is behind Trump's strategy in terms of Venezuela ?
>
>>[!answer]
>>He abducted a head of state of a foreign nation, and is determined to rule it. It can be attributed to vast oil reserves, albeit without efficient drilling due to costs, narcoterrorism, the country is a shipping stop for Cocaine entering the US, the country is a horrible place to live and has the highest rate of inflation in the world. In the second world war, when the option to drop a nuclear bomb, drop an atomic bomb, a ground invasion and so on. They are weighing the resulting consequences. Most people tend to have an ethical school of thought between Consequensialism and other schools of thought. 

#### Deontology

*Deon* in latin means **duty**. 

Your school of ethical thought is :

>[!hint]
>
>Someone else tells you what is ethical to do externally. You would have to do your duty regardless of how you feel about it. If you claim to follow one Deontological school of thought, you must follow the rules. 

>[!Example]
>
If you are in Nazi Germany, and a Jewish family is hiding in your attic, Deontological philosophy would tell you that you can not lie. The Gestapo arrives at your door. You have two choices :
>
>>1. "Yes. They are hiding in the attic"
>>2. Say Nothing!


# Ethics vs Morality 


Ethics are provided for you from outside. Ethics has a :

## Temporal Component

If you are raised in the deep south in the 1800s, you would believe that slavery is ethical. It is of the times. These things change over time, but the question is :

"**How do they change?**" 
They take in a lot of ethics from various sources, evaluate them within themselves and becomes their morality based on what they agree on.

What is acceptable from an ethical standpoint based on geography. Waste dumping happens when the waste is shipped away from Canada, and dumped in the third world. 


Opinions and Morality change over time.


There are people in the world, such as Buddhists, who refuse to take a life, even if they are threatening to kill them. There are other people who go by each circumstance and decide the best possible outcome. 

You can not make laws based on *ethics*. If you make laws based on how people feel, as doing so happens in Totalitarian states. Laws have to be made separate from ethical school of thoughts. 

If you look at theocracies in the world, they make terrifying places to live. Religion plays no role in Canadian public policies. There are no mention of religion in the public sphere. It is a scary route, where terrifying things happen. 


When making laws : 

1. Be Objective
2. Be Fair

There is a Code of Ethical Conduct in the CISSP Certification. They fall under the field that applies to us, which is **Applied Ethics**. 


If you are hired by a company, and you have signed their corporate policy for employee behaviour, it is a line of that ethical practice of a corporation. They say "This is what we consider appropriate behaviour, and you will follow it because you work for us."


Applied ethics is interesting , because it manages to get everything in regards to good behaviour down to the following rules : 


### Non-Malfeasance
Do not intentionally set out to harm others. Every ethical action must adhere to this simple rule :

>[!important]
>
>`"This action must make the situation better, and it is not allowed to make it worse"`

Consider the temporal aspect "Is what is good for me limited to myself only? how large is my ethical bubble?"


### Benefissance
Benefit others! 

### Atonomy 
Every time you have a professional development, this idea is prevalent :

>[!important]
>"Each person has autonomy, and no one should commandeer others. No one is allowed to decide what is good for another person". 


### Justice
"Every person in a society participates equally for costs and benefits in society. They are expected to contribute to society, and they have the right to be receive society's benefits"

>[!important]
You have to assess your **contribution**. Do not judge others based on contribution, but Judge the system that **restricts their benefits**.

If you have a corporate investigation, you would not report to anyone except the senior members of the organization. If you catch an employee stealing, you do not call the police, but you report it to the CEO. 

If you are doing a Forensic analysis of a worker's computer, and you find child pornography, you call the police. 

Ron knew someone who was a victim of a hidden camera of their child undressing. Ron was in transit for 24 hours, and he could not get to the local police station. When he arrived, he went to the police station. There is a law, where if you do not report a crime right away, you could face charges. 

If you find an email on the worker's computer, where there is evidence of themselves being involved in the drug trade, tell the CEO. It is possible that there are no laws that criminalizes you for knowledge of another person's drug trafficking activities.

You will have to understand the Ethical Component. It is critical because *it makes a difference in you being able to practice the trade*. You have to abide by the ethics of the trade. 

#### Evidence Locker vs Digital Evidence Locker
In real world, it is an actual locker. It has access logs and a guard and so on. We will learn how to handle cyber evidence. 


>[!note]

>Rules of Evidence, Admicibility of Evidence, etc ... will be handled first, and then we will proceed to the collection of evidence.
