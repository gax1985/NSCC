### Pilot Program - Grading

Grading for each skill evaluation works in the same manner:

60% (passing grade) = Successfully performed the hands-on work to the required criteria 

85% (honours grade*) = Successfully answered questions asked during the evaluation class with general answers that demonstrate their knowledge but lack the key details 

100% (full marks) = Successfully answered questions asked during the evaluation class with specific answers that consistently reference key details of the steps performed
 

The catch here is that if you are unable to meet the criteria for 60%, you will receive a 0% for that evaluation. DO NOT BE CONCERNED! Each module gives you three opportunities to perform the evaluation. After each attempt you will be provided with feedback to help you address where you didn’t meet the criteria.
