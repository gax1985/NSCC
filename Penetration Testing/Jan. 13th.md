# Reconnaissance



## Objectives

<number>

- Identify various techniques for performing reconnaissance 
    
- Distinguish and discuss the methods used in social engineering 
    
- Identify the variety of phases of footprinting 
    

>[!definition]
>Reconnaissance: 
>
>>A preliminary survey to gain information. It is an act of finding the target(s) and developing the methods necessary to attack those targets successfully 

	We have seen different types of information getting us to conduct a certain action such as visiting a website. A friend had an email of an overdue parking ticket. It was unpaidticket.canada.com. 

- - Flexibility and creativity is key 
        

- Reconnaissance is not, by definition, illegal 


Google maps is public information. We can ask Google to remove people's faces, license plates, etc. If the information is publically available, its a go!

Some Legal Reconnaissance

<number>

- Legal activities 
    

- - Looking up all of the information about a company available on the Internet 
        
    - Calling with a problem requiring customer service assistance 
        
    - Interviewing a member of the staff for a school project 
        
    - Limited physical entry of a facility such as attending a tour of the facility 
        
    - Making friends with somebody who works there or used to work there 
        

<number>

Some Questionable Reconnaissance

<number>

- Questionable activities 
    

- - Performing a port scan of their systems 
        
    - Scanning their WiFi network 
    - Reading the names on the mail sitting on a mail cart 
    - Reading a document lying loose on a desk 
    - Picking up trash in the parking lot 


<number>

Some Illegal Reconnaissance

<number>

- Illegal activities 
    

- - Developing a “front” company for the purpose of robbing or defrauding 
  
  This can be trickly. The **Yes Men Group** would set up fronts for companies that exist, like *Excon*, and they would set up a website. If someone was to contact them for interviews, they would agree. They did not do anything fraud-related, due to them not making any financial gains. 
        
    - Probing, scanning or interacting, in a way that is abnormal, could be construed as illegal 
If you are PING-scanning a company, not an issue. If you are doing Deep Scanning, you could get detained. 
        
    - Taking a document lying loose on a desk 
        
This is considered to be theft.
<number>

### Social Engineering

<number>

- Social engineering works, for the most part, because people are trusting and helpful 
  
  >[!note]
  >
  >Individuals assist those who dress in uniform!

- The weakest link in any security scheme is the user, just like any form of con artistry 
- The success of social engineering attacks typically rely on naivety and human error to be successful 

  >[!note]
  >
  >Individuals assist those who dress in uniform! If someone comes up in a police car, or there are other police units around, this adds to it. If you wanted to infiltrate a business, and you are not an employee. You would dress up as a Repairs Person. If you carry a ladder, people will let you in. 

<number>

Social Engineering Techniques

<number>

- Impersonation 
    

- - This can occur at various levels, including individual instances where one person imitates another, as well as on a broader scale involving roles or functions, such as dressing in the attire of a service person. 
        

<number>

Social Engineering Techniques

<number>

- Exploiting Greed 

  >[!note]
  >
  >During the **SpaceX** lancunches, two YouTube channels started talking about Cryptocurrencies, and mentioned that Elon Musk will double individuals' cryptocurrencies. They made it appear as if Musk is talking, but his lips were not moving. It was mentioned that he intended on getting people to use more cryptocurrencies. A link was provided, and the link would be set up to receive cryptocurrencies. 

- - Criminals can adeptly exploit individuals' innate desires for personal gain. By tapping into the allure of financial incentives or other forms of gratification, they strategically pit a person's greed against their allegiance to the organization. This psychological manipulation can be a potent tool for cyber adversaries seeking unauthorized access or compromising sensitive information. 
        

<number>

Social Engineering Techniques

<number>

- Unveiling Ignorance 
    
  >[!note]
  >
  >Another common tactic employed by cybercriminals is the exploitation of ignorance. By preying on gaps in knowledge or awareness within an organization, hackers can manipulate individuals into unknowingly jeopardizing organizational security. This method involves tricking employees or personnel into making decisions that compromise sensitive data, creating vulnerabilities that can be exploited. 
        

>[!example]
>
>There was a company that sent notices of interest sent to different individuals. They offered 10% raises. those individuals invited them for an interview, and they ended up discussing secrets.
<number>

Social Engineering Techniques

<number>

- Blackmail  
    

- - In addition to exploiting greed and ignorance, blackmail stands out as another prevalent tactic. Cyber adversaries may resort to coercive measures, threatening to expose compromising information unless their demands are met. This method not only challenges an individual's loyalty but also introduces a high-stakes dynamic that can have severe consequences for both the targeted person and the organization as a whole.

>[!example]
>
>There was an incident where a message would be sent to the target saying that they knew about the individual's embarrassing actions and threatened them with diclosure by informing all their friends unless they get a cryptocurrency transfer. 


<number>

Social Engineering Techniques (continued)

<number>

- Deception 
    

- - Achieve access to information by joining the company as an employee or a consultant 
        

Physical Intrusion

<number>

- Requires 
    

- - Learning the schedules of the organization 
        
    - Knowing the floor plan of the building or buildings 
        
    - “Baselining” the security procedures 
        
    - ID cards that are either fake or stolen 
        

Once inside they can acquire valuable information

>#### The Lufthansa Heist (from **Goodfellas**)
>
>The **Lufthansa heist** was a [robbery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery "Robbery") which took place at [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City")'s [John F. Kennedy International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport "John F. Kennedy International Airport") on December 11, 1978. An estimated [US$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar")5.875 million (equivalent to US$28.32 million in 2024) was stolen, with $5 million in cash and $875,000 in jewelry, making it the largest cash robbery committed in the U.S. at the time.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa_heist#cite_note-linhist-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa_heist#cite_note-NYTDec14-2)

[James Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_(gangster) "James Burke (gangster)"), an associate of the [Lucchese crime family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucchese_crime_family "Lucchese crime family") of New York, was reputed to be the mastermind of the robbery, but was never officially charged in connection with the crime. Burke is also alleged to have either committed or ordered the murders of many co-conspirators in the robbery, both to avoid being implicated in the heist and to keep their shares of the money for himself.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa_heist#cite_note-:0-3) The only person convicted in the Lufthansa heist was Louis Werner, an airport worker involved with the planning.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa_heist#cite_note-:0-3)

The money and jewelry have never been recovered. The heist's magnitude made it one of the longest-investigated crimes in U.S. history; the latest arrest associated with the robbery was made in 2014, which resulted in [acquittal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal "Acquittal").
