# Ethics of Hacking


### White Hat

Ethical hackers. You would want to portray yourself as a White Hat Hacker. 

### Grey Hat : 

refers to most people out there. They violate laws, but have no ill intentions behind breaking these laws. Vigilantes do this for the fun, political motivations , etc. 

### Blackhat 

Stereotypical type of hackers. They would have different motivations. They would support criminal acts, illegally attack systems with the motivations of monetary gains and ransom. They could have a variety of motivations. 



The terminology comes from 1920s films. In some of the Western movies, the terms are being used as well. During the Silent Era, people needed a visual reference to understand who is who.

In 1884 [Arizona Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Territory "Arizona Territory"), Dan Evans is a poor rancher and [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War") veteran who owes money to Glen Hollander, a local banker in the town of [Bisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisbee,_Arizona "Bisbee, Arizona"). Hollander's men burn down his barn and scatter his cattle as a warning to pay his debts. The next morning, Evans and his two sons search for their herd but stumble upon Ben Wade and his gang robbing a [stagecoach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagecoach "Stagecoach") staffed by [Pinkertons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkerton_Government_Services "Pinkerton Government Services"). Wade sees Evans and his two sons watching from the hills and decides that they are not a threat to his gang. He takes their horses to prevent them from giving warning about the robbery. Wade promises to leave the horses tied up "on the road to [Bisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisbee,_Arizona "Bisbee, Arizona")", so that Evans can recover them. After Wade's gang departs, Evans rescues the lone surviving coach guard, Pinkerton Agent Byron McElroy.



The 1903 short film "The Great Train Robbery" was the first film to use the term.

Response to Compatible Time Sharing System

### Deciding What to Secure 


- Data provided to organizations or stored on personal computers is a high priority
- Using bandwidth without permission may seem harmless, but it is not only unethical, but illegal
- Many hackers find it tempting to copy, download, and use proprietary software and other copyrighted works

### Ethical Issues of Hacking

- Professional hackers have a responsibility to society
    - Their activities should help to build and improve upon existing technology
    - They should use their skills and interests as opportunities to learn and to teach
