Here is a summary of the provided notes:

The Capstone proposal requires specific actions and goals, with tasks potentially starting mid-milestone and overlapping with others. Weekly Scrum meetings will be held to discuss progress and challenges, while also emphasizing the importance of realistic task expectations.

Regarding ethics, it's essential to consider one's own moral compass and not lie to oneself. The provided notes highlight the significance of ethics in corporate governance, citing the Equifax hack incident where the CEO downplayed the severity of the breach. This serves as an example of the need for ethical considerations in business decision-making.

Lessons learned from the Equifax hack include the importance of not ignoring responsibilities and taking personal responsibility when a breach occurs. Documentation is also crucial during incident handling and response.

Additionally, there is information on the Personal Health Information Act from Nova Scotia Legislature (2010), which outlines responsibilities for custodians, researchers, and substitute decision-makers regarding personal health information.

The act regulates personal health information and data breaches, outlining rules for obtaining consent, handling records, conducting research, and reviewing/correcting personal health information.

I have a project where we would make a Packet Tracer module that would be implemented physically in class. We have two lab computers for our group, and our own switch (CISCO Catalyst 3560) and Router (CISCO 4321). May I ask you for your humble guidance on providing me with the correct approach to tackle this noble task? I need to get the module working first in Packet Tracer, and after that is done, implement it physically!.

We need to create VLAN 9 , and connect our switch with the other group's switch.
