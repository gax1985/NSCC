Oreilly Web Application Security 





He has been in the IT industry for 5 years, been teaching for 12 years. He taught cybersecurity year 2. This is his only class for this semester. 



He did civilian and military cybersecurity. He is certificed in Windows NT 4 . 

We are already familiar with policies, which we can read : Be respectful to everything! When we leave this place, if we leave on a good note, thats even better. 



He is our resource through all of this. He wont give us answers, but he will help us as much as he can. 



The people that make it to the 2nd year are usually sticking it out. 


Focus on learning and practical knowledge/skills. 


He is open to feedback!

He expects us to abide by all the policies. 


Try,Try and Try again! We do not win everything. We will fail plenty!



If we are struggling with anything talk to him and Ron. Ron teaches us more than he does. He does not have a phone number.

When emailing him, put the course number in the Subject. His response expectation is 48 hours. 


If we send him an email at 10 PM at night, expect a response the next day. We can talk to him about missing deadlines. Treat it like a job.
