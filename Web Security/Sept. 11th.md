Today , we will go through the **Juice Shop** Installation!


When we go through Kali/Linux Installation, we get the option for putting in various partitions. Often, there is an option for letting the Kali Linux Installer of auto-partitioning the virtual hard drive.


When we start partitioning out the hard drive, we can do a root partition, and we create different directories. 


There is an important folder called **/var/log** that could seriously impede our Kali Linux installation. It is advisable to create a separate partition for the **/var/log** folder.


## Installation Steps ( in VMWARE)



1. Create the virtual machine 
2. We boot up the virtual machine
3. We get to the Kali Linux installer
4. We select the language
5. We enter the hostname (**kali** for example)
6. We leave **Domain Name** as *blank*
7. We enter the password
8. We select the time zone (Atlantic)
9. We get to the **Partitioning** section : 
   
>[!critical]
>
>Manual - We would do the manual partitioning
>Encrypted - Everything would be encrypted
>We choose the second option Guided ---
>
>We should choose **Separate /home /var and /tmp partitions** !
>
>###### Why should we do so ?
>
>Because the system will *fail to boot* if the **/var/log** folder decided to use the entire available disk space on the drive!

>###### EXT4
>
>It is the de-facto partitioning method for Linux-based systems. One of the problems that Microsoft had with FAT32 and NTFS is when you install an application, the files for it would be placed in different areas of the the drive (hence, defragmenting drives). EXT4 uses a certain algorithm to keep files in the same area, and it has other features like *journaling*

>Virtual Paging is not that much slower than actual RAM



#### JuiceShop Installation 


1. We should have Kali updated and upgraded!
   
   >[!command]
   >
   >``sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y``
   >


2. OWASP has created the package with different methods of installation. We will install it from source!

	[juice-shop/juice-shop: OWASP Juice Shop: Probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application (github.com)](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop)

	1. install NodeJS (OWAP has a chart for NodeJS compatibility. sudo apt install nodejs will yield version 20 )
	2. Run `git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git --depth 1` (or clone [your own fork](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/fork) of the repository)

	3. Go into the cloned folder with `cd juice-shop`
	4. Run `npm install` (only has to be done before first start or when you change the source code) 
	5. Run `npm start`

#### Explanation for the *--depth* portion of the *git clone* command (from the **JuiceShop** installation)


Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

- **Basic Syntax**: `git clone --depth <depth> <repository-url>`
    
- **Purpose**: By specifying a depth, you are telling Git to only retrieve the most recent `<depth>` number of commits from the repository. This can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be downloaded and can make the cloning process faster, especially for large repositories with long histories.
    
- **Example**: If you run `git clone --depth 1 <repository-url>`, Git will only fetch the most recent commit and its corresponding snapshot of the files, leaving out all the older history.
    
- **Use Cases**: Shallow clones are useful when you only need the latest state of the repository for tasks like testing or building, but don’t need to explore the full history or perform operations that require the complete commit history.
    
- **Limitations**: Some operations, like creating branches based on older commits or accessing detailed commit history, might not be possible with a shallow clone. You can, however, convert a shallow clone into a full clone later using the `git fetch --unshallow` command if needed.
    

Here’s a practical example:

sh

Copy code

`git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/example/repo.git`

This command will create a shallow clone of the repository from `https://github.com/example/repo.git`, including only the most recent commit and not the full history.

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!
