For this week, we have a small assignment and reading of **Chapter 13**. 


We are starting to talk about **Flaws in Code**. 


At one time, when people programmed, they put code together. You can do the same when you fix cars. For the most part, it worked!


Just because it works, it does not mean it will go well ...

Some programmers are inflexible with change. There could be something that you do that could be flawed. 


The sample script in the book involved Java and PHP. PHP is still common!


PHP can be used for both frontend and backend. It is used mostly in the backend. 


Java is very old, but it is portable. Java and JavaScript are not related. 


Java is one language, and JavaScript involves Scripting. 


Programmer Security Consultants are in high demand!


Project Management is huge too! We will also be exposed to **Agile Development** as well!


BASH and Pythons are the-go-to!
