Constraints :


Deliverables  :

Python Executable that runs, allows you to input a CSV file and the the Program Map, from both of those, the maps get scanned , dependencies are determined, excel document gets read and data analyzed, map gets read, bind , correlate things, then when it done, an interactive display gets displayed. 


We are missing the W00 number.


Markdown allows you to shift units around. 

Assume that before anything is rendered : 

1. there is a field asks for the w00 number. It would be a box, and when you press the number, the information pertaining to the student information , current program, and the program's plan. 




Evan's Tasks :

1. Database : Do we need a database :  "Assume the drawn box is an app. The box would be for the W00 number. Information gets loaded in. When you search the W00 number, you get a box, C-Graph : a recreation of the program map document, and formatted in a way you can see everything visually. Generate the path forwards, populates the page , Latex/Markdown gets created, take an image of the PDF, show it in the GUI, and superimpose the dropdown menu, When you change something in the dropdown menu, it makes changes in the Latex code. We would need a template Markdown file, and we can change the file to show dropdowns. If the image is a static image, we are not editing the image, but changing Latex/Markdown format. The PDF would have an editable textbox. We can have a Markdown frame that can be saved, loaded again and still export the thing to PDF. We do not edit the PDF file!

Mohammad's TODO list : 

Create a Wireframe of the sample Alternate Pathway Plan, and adapt the code needed to convert the .MD file to PDF. Write a development journal documenting everything. Generate the Presentation. 

Brad's TODO : 

Compile Python program with a GUI, with different dummy windows for now, and we can help you with sample data. We would be feeding to you a Function with a W00 number, and that would return the course map  

AllTheInformationYouNeedForMap = *function(WNumber)*. 

It returns the filtered information, and gets passed down into Markdown creation. 
There is a Python library that can open .XLS files. 





## Timeframe : 


Checkin tomorrow 


** Meeting on Wednesday **  --> We need to keep the scope of this constrained, because we would not have anything at the end of the week. 

Deliverable : End of day Thursday. pick apart the journal, pick up the code.
Friday : Documentation for the project.
