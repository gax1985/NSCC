# Initial Access

What is it?  
Techniques that allow attackers to gain a foothold within your environment or accounts. Some common techniques are:

### External Remote Services

_Explanation:_ Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in services like VPNs, RDP, or other remote access tools. These services can provide a gateway into internal networks if not secured properly.

### Social Engineering

_Explanation:_ This involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information, often through phishing emails or deceptive phone calls. Attackers exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities.

### Cloud accounts (and synchronization to local accounts)

_Explanation:_ Many organizations use cloud services for convenience. However, if these accounts are compromised, attackers can synchronize sensitive data to local machines, bypassing traditional security measures.

### Hardware Additions

_Explanation:_ This refers to attackers physically adding devices (like keyloggers or rogue Wi-Fi hotspots) to the environment, which can capture data or provide unauthorized access.

### Supply Chain Attacks

_Explanation:_ Attackers target the supply chain by compromising a vendor or partner's systems to gain access to their clients. This method can introduce malware into trusted environments.

### Removable Media

_Explanation:_ USB drives or other removable media can be used to introduce malware into a network. If employees unknowingly connect infected devices, it can lead to significant breaches.

## VPNs

A classic method for a remote worker to reach internal resources. However, where before an attacker would have to be physically in an office space or compromise an internal resource to gain access to an internal network, they can place their own machine with malicious software on a network if they can compromise a VPN. This opens the possibility of breaches from anywhere in the world. Some common issues with VPNs are:

### Old or misconfigured protocols (PPTP, IKE with aggressive)

_Explanation:_ Many VPNs still use outdated protocols that have known vulnerabilities. If these protocols are not properly configured, they can be easily exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to internal networks.

### No MFA

_Explanation:_ Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification in addition to a password. Without MFA, compromised credentials alone can lead to significant breaches.

### No lockout policy

_Explanation:_ A lockout policy prevents repeated login attempts after a set number of failures. Without this policy, attackers can use brute-force methods to guess passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

### No device control

_Explanation:_ Device control ensures that only authorized devices can connect to the VPN. Without this, an attacker could potentially connect any device, including those compromised with malware.

---

### VPNs - Old and misconfigured protocols

#### PPTP

_Explanation:_ Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is outdated and uses MS-Chapv2 for authentication, which exposes usernames in plaintext. Attackers can easily crack these credentials, especially in spoofed Wi-Fi scenarios.

#### IKE with Aggressive Mode

_Explanation:_ Internet Key Exchange (IKE) with aggressive mode allows attackers to capture the pre-shared key (PSK) hash. If they obtain this hash, they only need the user’s credentials to gain access to the VPN, making it a common target for exploitation.

---

### VPNs - The Correct

**Best Practices:**

- **Use an SSL VPN (comes with most firewalls) with MFA**  
    _Explanation:_ SSL VPNs provide secure connections and are compatible with modern encryption standards. Coupled with MFA, they significantly enhance security.
    
- **Enforce IP or user lockout**  
    _Explanation:_ Implementing lockout policies helps protect against brute-force attacks by disabling accounts after several failed login attempts.
    
- **MAC filtering**  
    _Explanation:_ MAC filtering allows organizations to specify which devices can connect to the VPN based on their unique MAC addresses, providing an additional layer of security.
    
- **Country IP filtering**  
    _Explanation:_ By restricting VPN access to specific countries, organizations can prevent unauthorized connections from regions known for high cybercrime rates.
    

---

### Q&A Pairs

**Q1: Why are outdated VPN protocols like PPTP a risk?**  
**A1:** Outdated protocols have known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit, such as exposing usernames in plaintext and being easily crackable for credentials.

**Q2: How does multi-factor authentication (MFA) enhance VPN security?**  
**A2:** MFA adds an extra verification step beyond just a password, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain access even if they have compromised a password.

**Q3: What is the purpose of a lockout policy in VPN security?**  
**A3:** A lockout policy limits the number of failed login attempts before an account is temporarily disabled, which helps mitigate brute-force attacks.

**Q4: How does MAC filtering improve VPN security?**  
**A4:** MAC filtering restricts access to the VPN to only authorized devices, reducing the likelihood that an attacker can connect using an unauthorized or compromised device.

**Q5: What are the benefits of using SSL VPNs over older protocols?**  
**A5:** SSL VPNs offer stronger encryption, better compatibility with modern security standards, and enhanced access controls, making them more secure than older protocols like PPTP or IKE with aggressive mode.

    SolarWinds is a SaaS company specializing in IT management and administration. The attack focused on their **Orion** software, a performance monitoring solution.
    
- **The Attack:**  
    Attackers inserted malicious code into a DLL file used by Orion, which was digitally signed by SolarWinds, thus appearing legitimate. This backdoor enabled the attackers to compromise any organization using the software.
    
- **How the Backdoor Operated:**  
    The malicious code evaded antivirus detection by compiling commands in memory rather than writing them to disk. It was designed to reactivate itself if detected. This multi-stage approach helped it avoid traditional security measures, as many antivirus solutions could not sandbox the dynamically compiled C# code effectively.
    

### Importance of Security Checks

_Explanation:_ Organizations using third-party SaaS solutions should conduct thorough **SOC 2** assessments to ensure proper security practices.

## Lessons Learned

- **Perform Code Reviews:**  
    Regular code reviews are essential, even though they can be time-consuming and complex.
    
- **Active Monitoring:**  
    Implement continuous monitoring of systems to detect anomalies and potential threats early.
    
- **Implement Multiple Security Layers:**  
    Use tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) to enhance security.
    
- **Have an Incident Response Plan (IR Plan):**  
    Prepare for potential breaches with a well-defined incident response plan to minimize damage and restore operations quickly.

### Removable Media

Removable media poses significant security risks, especially when users leave their computers unattended. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability using devices like **Rubber Duckies** or USB drives to gain access to sensitive information or install malicious software.

### Key Tools and Techniques

#### Rubber Ducky

- **What is a Rubber Ducky?**  
    _Explanation:_ A Rubber Ducky is a USB device that emulates a keyboard. When plugged into a computer, it can execute pre-loaded scripts rapidly, allowing attackers to run commands (like PowerShell scripts) without user interaction.
    
- **Use in Attacks:**  
    Attackers can load scripts that create a backdoor or install malware on the target machine. Since it appears as a keyboard, it’s hard for users to detect its malicious intent.
    
- **Detection:**  
    You can remotely check for connected devices via SSH, which can help identify if a Rubber Ducky or similar device has been attached to a system.
    

#### Keyloggers

- **Types of Keyloggers:**  
    There are two primary types of keyloggers:
    
    1. **Software Keyloggers:**  
        _Explanation:_ These programs run on the target computer, capturing keystrokes and often evading User Access Control (UAC) prompts.
    2. **Hardware Keyloggers:**  
        _Explanation:_ Physical devices placed between a keyboard and the PC, capable of capturing all keystrokes regardless of UAC prompts. They act as a proxy, making them hard to notice.
- **Functionality:**  
    Keyloggers can record and transmit keystrokes back to the attacker. They often go unnoticed by the victim, posing significant privacy and security threats.
    

### Removable Media Risks

- **Physical Access Required:**  
    Attackers typically need physical access to the victim's device to exploit removable media. This can be achieved through:
    
    - **USB Drop Attacks:**  
        _Explanation:_ An attacker leaves USB drives in public places, hoping curious individuals will plug them into their computers, thus executing any malware on the drive.
- **Curiosity Factor:**  
    Many people are naturally curious and may pick up an abandoned USB drive, leading to inadvertent security breaches.
    
- **Research Reference:**  
    For a deeper understanding of USB drop attacks, refer to the study: [Does Dropping USB Drives in Parking Lots and Other Places Really Work?](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Bursztein-Does-Dropping-USB-Drives-In-Parking-Lots-And-Other-Places-Really-Work.pdf).

### Q&A Pairs

**Q1: What is a Rubber Ducky, and how is it used in cyber attacks?**  
**A1:** A Rubber Ducky is a USB device that emulates a keyboard and can execute pre-loaded scripts rapidly when plugged into a computer. Attackers use it to run malicious commands without the user’s knowledge.

**Q2: What are the differences between software and hardware keyloggers?**  
**A2:** Software keyloggers are programs that run on the target computer, capturing keystrokes and often bypassing security prompts. Hardware keyloggers are physical devices placed between the keyboard and PC that capture all keystrokes without relying on software, making them harder to detect.

**Q3: How can keyloggers be used to compromise security?**  
**A3:** Keyloggers can capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages. This information can then be transmitted to attackers, leading to identity theft and unauthorized access.

**Q4: What are USB drop attacks, and why are they effective?**  
**A4:** USB drop attacks involve leaving infected USB drives in public spaces, hoping that someone will plug them into their computer. They are effective because people’s curiosity often leads them to connect unknown devices, exposing their systems to malware.

**Q5: What measures can organizations take to mitigate risks from removable media?**  
**A5:** Organizations can implement policies prohibiting the use of removable media, conduct security training to raise awareness, use endpoint protection solutions, and monitor USB ports to detect unauthorized devices.
