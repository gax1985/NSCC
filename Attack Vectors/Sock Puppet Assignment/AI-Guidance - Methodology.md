You can use **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)** tools to conduct an online search for small-to-medium sized companies (SMEs) and filter the results to view only SMEs. Here are some steps and tools you can use:

1. **Define SME Criteria**: First, you need to define what constitutes a small-to-medium sized company in your target country. This can vary by country and industry. For example, in the U.S., the Small Business Administration (SBA) defines SMEs based on the number of employees and annual revenue3.
    
2. **Use OSINT Tools**: There are several OSINT tools available that can help you gather information about companies. Some popular tools include:
    
    - **Google Search**: Use specific search queries to find companies that match your SME criteria.
        
    - **LinkedIn**: Search for companies and filter by size (e.g., small businesses, medium-sized businesses).
        
    - **Company Websites and Directories**: Use online directories like Yellow Pages, Bing Places, and industry-specific directories1.
        
    - **Social Media**: Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter can provide information about companies1.
        
3. **Filter Results**: Use advanced search techniques to filter the results and view only SMEs. For example, you can use search operators in Google to narrow down your results.
    
4. **Visualize Data**: Use tools like mind maps or spreadsheets to organize and visualize the data you collect.
