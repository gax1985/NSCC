The vast amount of data available on the Internet is publicly accessible. Organizations leverage the Internet to help communicate their companies’ following products and services, their financial earnings report and key customer wins. Currently, [66%](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/internet/internet-statistics/) of the world’s population uses the Internet daily. With this access comes the additional data.

According to [Exploding Topics](https://explodingtopics.com/), data continues to increase on the internet daily at a rate most will find hard to fathom.

-   Approximately **77 million terabytes** of data are created each day.
-   **A total of 181 zettabytes** of data will be generated in 2025.
-   Videos account for **over half** of internet data traffic.

Much open-source data is bound to news, media, social media profiles, company websites, learning institutions, blogs, Wiki posts, and online publications.

Public information regarding previous cybersecurity threats, including data breaches, insider threats, and other criminal activities, is a standard search content piece for OSINT. Organizations can learn a great deal by studying previous attacks against other organizations.  

## How Vital are OSINT Tools for Cybersecurity, Journalism, and Law Enforcement Industries?

Many industries search, process, and rationalize open-source data. The modern-day news cycle requires journalists to be first with the big story. Often, a big tale starts with scattered information across several unconnected resources.

OSINT is ideal for journalists to use to capture story fragments and create a narrative based on the open-source information captured. Ultimately, this narrative becomes the lead news clip or the foundation for the blog.

Like journalism, cybersecurity benefits from accessing source-gathering tools using advanced search techniques. Gathering threats from previous [cyberattacks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10014398/), messages embedded within social media sites forecasting upcoming attacks are valuable snippets.

Cybersecurity devices generate a significant amount of data. Most security telemetry data will not be released to the public. However, security vendors will provide deeper insight into breaches of the [source code](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/cloudflare-source-code-breach-lessons-learned) embedded within their products and recommend patching their solutions. Public data analysis tools provide the means to capture and identify critical notifications from security vendors and the patch release timeline. With nearly 20,000 security vendors globally, OSINT tools will help set a priority flag as part of their workflow.

[Law enforcement](https://www.hsaj.org/articles/22143) also captures similar cybersecurity alerts as part of their investigations. Many law enforcement agencies capture open-source content through various online investigation tools, either specific to a criminal they are investigating or an organization under suspicion. News articles, publications, and podcasts are excellent sources of content law enforcement can add as artifacts to their cases. Leveraging OSINT tools helps expedite the data-capturing process more than just using a browser search page.

## How are Open-Source Tools Regulated in Germany and the EU?

![](https://forenova.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-png-Apr-29-2024-06-27-22-4661-AM.webp)

Germany now has a [federal open-source](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Open%20Source%20Software%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report%20-%20Germany.docx.pdf) policy focusing on digital sovereignty. The Centre for Digital Sovereignty of Public Administration ([ZenDiS](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Factsheet%20Germany.pdf)) was created in 2022 to support this initiative.

-   The German government is leading a digital transformation to increase its sovereignty with initiatives like OpenCoDE.de and a cloud strategy. This shift inspires public administrations and civil society to embrace open-source solutions.

-   “Germany’s [public sector](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Open%20Source%20Software%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report%20-%20Germany.docx.pdf) has a robust open-source ecosystem, with many actors and vendors providing secure digital solutions.”

The coordination of open-source initiatives between state and federal levels is still evolving. German cities are expressing interest in utilizing open source despite potential challenges in coordinating with federal governance. As the landscape evolves, federal policies are increasingly promoting the use of open source in all public administrations.

## What is DarkGPT?

![](https://forenova.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-png-Apr-29-2024-06-31-25-3993-AM.webp)

Developed with common attributes like ChatGPT, [DarkGPT](https://flowgpt.com/p/darkgpt-official-edition) simply became a jailbroken version of OpenAI’s tool. ChatGPT and its various large language models (LLMs) have various guardrails incorporated into their framework.

These guardrails only allow the processing of open-source data instead of copyrighted content from published authors. ChatGPT also has restrictions around the queries prompt engineers can leverage. DarkGPT removes these guardrails and more.

Having the ability to generate rogue hacking code to execute a data breach, DOS attack, or a video game based on illegal activities is at the heart of DarkGPT.

DarkGPT empowered the user to access several open-source data and private content embedded within the public domain. DarkGPT can now query content restricted to ChatGPT, including dark art and dark aspects of human existence, and ask pointed questions about the dark side of a writer, director, or politician.

## What is the Risk in OSINT Tools?

Attackers often use OSINT to execute a social engineering attack on employees from social media platforms or using email spear-phishing attacks. LinkedIn and other social networking sites are valuable sources of information for attackers, as they reveal personal details that can be used for phishing and password guessing.

![](https://forenova.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-png-Apr-29-2024-06-32-05-4820-AM.webp)

Content shared on social media and professional networks may seem harmless at first. However, cyber attackers can exploit this information alongside existing vulnerabilities to launch cyber attacks.

Using cloud resources, attackers can scan for vulnerable assets, open ports, and misconfigured data stores. They can also find credentials and other information on GitHub, where developers sometimes unknowingly share sensitive data in their code.

## Is Open-Source always better?

While open-source intelligence tools (OSINT) provide valuable insights and data from public sources, their optimal utilization requires expertise and specialized knowledge. These tools offer a vast amount of information that can be harnessed for various purposes, including cybersecurity, journalism, and law enforcement.
