## About us

We are a multi-asset, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying and developing novel treatments for rare diseases and diseases caused by multi-drug resistant ("MDR”) bacterial infections with high unmet need. Our pipeline consists of three mid to late-stage clinical assets. Tebipenem HBr is in Phase 3 development, with the potential to be the first broad-spectrum oral carbapenem to treat complicated urinary tract infections ("cUTIs”) including acute pyelonephritis, caused by certain microorganisms, in adult patients. SPR206 is a Phase 2 ready IV-administered antibiotic being developed as an innovative option to treat MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections in the hospital setting. SPR720, the development of which was recently suspended, is a Phase 2 investigational oral agent for the first-line treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial ("NTM”) pulmonary disease, a rare disease. As previously disclosed, following the SPR720 program suspension, we are evaluating other potential paths forward as the remaining data are collected and analyzed.
