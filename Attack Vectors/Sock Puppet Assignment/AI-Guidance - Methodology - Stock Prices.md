Using stock prices to find small-to-medium sized businesses (SMEs) can be a bit tricky, as many SMEs are privately held and don't have publicly traded stock. However, if you're looking for publicly traded SMEs, you can use stock prices as part of your research. Here are a few steps to help you with this:

1. **Identify Publicly Traded SMEs**: Use stock market databases like **Yahoo Finance**, **Bloomberg**, or **Google Finance** to search for companies that match your criteria for SMEs. You can filter by market capitalization to find smaller companies.
    
2. **Analyze Financial Data**: Once you've identified potential SMEs, you can analyze their financial data, including stock prices, earnings reports, and other financial metrics. This can give you insights into the company's performance and stability.
    
3. **Use Stock Screeners**: Many financial websites offer stock screeners that allow you to filter companies based on various criteria, including market capitalization, industry, and financial performance. This can help you narrow down your search to SMEs.
    
4. **Look for Industry-Specific Indices**: Some industries have specific indices that track the performance of SMEs within that sector. For example, the **Russell 2000 Index** tracks small-cap stocks in the U.S.
    
5. **Consult Financial Advisors**: If you're serious about investing in SMEs, consulting with a financial advisor can provide valuable insights and help you make informed decisions.
