## Jan. 6th

The organization can be visualized as a **Circle** with a **treasure** inside. The **Attack Surface** is the barrier around it. Ron developed a **Virtual Modelling** and **Haptic System**, allowing users to touch virtual objects. In **Virtual Reality**, you see objects; in **Haptic Reality**, you touch and feel vibrations.

To define an object's surface, you test **vectors** (direction, force, speed). The **Attack Surface** of an organization includes all potential points of contact, such as laptops, datacenters, servers, or doors. Each possible contact point is an **Attack Vector**. Reconnaissance involves extensive research on the target, often taking months.

Ron shared a story about a client with commercial wireless routers that had a backdoor, emphasizing the depth of reconnaissance required. He also discussed meeting influential people in cybersecurity and the importance of networking and attending conferences.

To excel in cybersecurity, focus on:

1. Identifying and understanding key people/systems.
2. Attending relevant conferences and events.
3. Committing to learning and networking.

Reconnaissance often targets **people** within an organization, finding details about their lives to tailor phishing attacks.

**Network Sub Vectors of Public-Facing Network Attacks:**
1. **VPN Access**
2. **Website**
3. **Actual Endpoints** (e.g., home computers, Wi-Fi, IoT devices)

- **Email**
- **Cloud**
- **DNS**
- **Physical**
- **Social Engineering (Phone calls)**

**First Assignment:**
- The task involves creating multiple fake online identities.
- These identities should have a history and life, maintained even after graduation.
- The assignment includes identifying a victim in a real company, studying them thoroughly, and creating social media profiles to interact with them.
- Ensuring anonymity and security by using public Wi-Fi for initial account setup, avoiding traces back to personal information.

**Important Points:**
- Use VPNs and anonymous email services for maintaining fake identities.
- Avoid associating fake profiles with real-life information to prevent detection.
- The exercise is meant to practice reconnaissance and social engineering skills.

Here is the summary of the 1st Assignment on the **People** attack vector:

### Reconnaissance
1. Understand the people involved in your target.
2. Study the organization chart.
3. Identify all roles and people.
4. Client may not provide all information.
5. Malicious targets: 6 months to a year of reconnaissance.
6. May not get everyone.
7. Weaknesses: LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.

### Fixes
1. Employees shouldn't identify their employer on social media.
2. Inactive social media accounts if not job hunting.
3. LinkedIn offers based on profiles are likely scams.
4. Avoid using the same profile picture across platforms.
5. Revisit **OSINT Assignment** techniques.
6. Reconnaissance based on the employer can provide a lot of information.
7. Be mindful of shared social media content.

### Targeting on Social Media
1. Identify clubs, volunteer activities, recreation, religious affiliations.
2. Send Spear-Phishing emails aligned with their interests.
3. Establish a domain fitting their interests.
4. Build trust online before sending phishing emails.
5. Bypass anti-phishing apps by aging the domain 30-60 days.
6. Establish legitimate email entry points within the organization.
7. Use emails from established chains to avoid spam filters.

### Target Identification
- Focus on small-medium size enterprises of interest to Chinese hackers.
- Get approval for the company and target individual from Ron.
- Identify targets based on job descriptions, not necessarily key figures.
- Study the organization and identify potential targets for spoofing.
- Use domain registration tactics to spoof communications.

### Avoid Leaving Breadcrumbs
1. Social media platforms detect bots and fake accounts.
2. Avoid using VPNs for account creation.
3. Use public Wi-Fi without daily habit affiliation.
4. Use untraceable emails and phone numbers.
5. Maintain online personas with consistent activity.

Here is a summary of the points mentioned:

### Key Considerations for Creating Fake Accounts
1. Assume adversaries have more resources and experience detecting fake accounts.
2. Activities posted should not conflict with the created persona.
3. Post convincing information relevant to the persona's interests.
4. Ensure all activity is consistent and has a history.
5. Use **Incognito Browsing** to avoid storing local history, though ISPs can still see activity.
6. Assume adversaries have access to your information.
7. Think about who you are going to be (e.g., online journalists writing fiction).
8. Volunteer activities can help build a convincing persona.
9. If close to the algorithm, systems may automatically connect you with others.
10. Industries under constant attack will be paranoid and protective of their information.
11. Achieving assignment objectives like establishing an account involves creating a comprehensive **Dossier**.
12. If unable to find enough information about a target, select a different one.
13. Ron values effort more than perfection.

### What Not To Do
1. Avoid creating personas with similar qualifications or backgrounds to the target.
2. Do not claim to have attended the same school or lived in the same town.
3. Do not forget to use a VPN when creating accounts.
4. Be cautious about mistakes in fake accounts.
5. Do not contact the target directly.

### Where to Use These Techniques
1. **Penetration Testing:** Manage accounts tediously; adversaries won't access algorithm history.
2. **Dark Web Investigations:** More complex due to adversaries' resources.

### Assignments and Work Schedule
- Focus on various assignments including data breaches and network configurations.
- Use lab classes on Friday mornings for work.
- Adjust industry meeting schedules as needed.
- Emphasize discipline and timely completion of tasks.

### Additional Notes
- **Signaling** does not work in cybersecurity.
- Practical experiences and guest lectures will be provided.
- Aim to secure employment in the cybersecurity field, considering industry and geographical preferences.
- Research entrepreneurs with research capital and focus on intellectual property and scientific breakthroughs.

### Sock Puppets Assignment Summary

**ISEC 3077 Assignment 1: Attack Vectors and Techniques**
- **Issued Date:** January 8, 2025
- **Due Date:** February 7, 2025

**Preamble:**
- Objective: Protect your identity online during reconnaissance by creating "sock puppet" (false) accounts.
