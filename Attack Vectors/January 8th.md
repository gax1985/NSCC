We are looking at the first attack vector, which is **people**!


This is something not necessarily covered in detail in other programs, and that gets them alot of praise ( of those who focus on this attack vector).

In an attack, the first mission is ...

## Reconnaissance


1. Understand the people involved in your target
2. Study the organization chart for the target
3. Identify all the people in the organization, and what their roles are.
4. The client may not necessarily provide you with all the information
5. for a typical malicious target, you can spend 6 months to a year. 
6. You may not get everyone!
7. Some weaknesses are **LinkedIn**, **Facebook**, etc ... 
   

##### Fixes :

1. The employees should not identify their employer on their social media account.
2. If you are not looking for a job, why would you have an active account?
3. If you think that someone in the world that will contact you and offer you a position based on your LinkedIn account, it is a scam! 
4. Ron would attempt to shut it down, but then all the more reasons arise to prevent him from doing so (promotions for the program).
5. Using the same profile picture from LinkedIn on Facebook is a bad idea. Do not use a picture that could lead back to you. 
6. We should revisit the techniques from the **OSINT Assignment** from last year. 
7. A simple reconnaissance based on the employer will give you a large amount of information. 
8. Consider about the other things you have shared on social media

If targeting a singular person on social media : 

1. What clubs do they belong to?
2. Volunteer activities?
3. Recreational ? 
4. Religious affiliation 
5. ... Something that gives us some insight into their personal life.
6. Send them a Spear-Phishing email that is part of their interest, and would coincide with the group they are a part of. For example, if someone is volunteering to aid the homeless, they could get an email pretending to be from the group they volunteer at. People are most likely to respond
7. Where does the spear-phishing email come from ? You have to establish a domain that fits their interests. The target would be able to go on and find a website associated with it. Building the depth will increase their chances of clicking on it. 
8. Some anti-phishing applications will check the age of the domain, and then alert the user. 90% of the domains online are not malicious, but pages created recently are indeed malicious!
9. 30-60 days should be enough to bypass it!
10. You would want to establish a relationship of trust with someone online.
11. Another way to break past the trust filter in anti-spamming filters is to find a *legitimate entry point to send the organization an email, and have someone in the organization respond to you*. You send the email to that account , which is meant to receive emails from any domain. If you have an employee willing and ready to receive the email, they will respond...
12. Then, you can reply to that email with the phishing email. Because you are a part of the email chain they have participated in, the email will not get blocked due to the established trust. 'I have noticed we have something in common' in the phishing email helps! Spear-Phishing emails would be sent in the third or fourth email after establishing trust. 'I have ran into you at last year's DEFCON' would be more enticing.



## Target Identification


Ron would like us to focus on small-medium size enterprises in the United States. The category should fit with the list of categories listed in the assignment, which would be an organization that would be of interest for Chinese hackers. For every step of the assignment, you have to have *every step approved*! Ideally, you would send Ron the company and the person of interest in the organization for approval. You have to find someone whose online presence is very prominent. You would need to find someone who you would think might have access materials you are after  based on their job description. They might not be necessarily a research scientist, but could be a secretary of a research scientist. You will not likely target someone who is in charge of Cyber-security in the organization, or expressed interest in IT. Support personnel are a regular target. They would have access to confidential materials, but not make them a person in charge. You have to study every aspect of this person's life. You may have to look at the organization as a whole to identify someone who we can spoof their identity in the organization. 

How would this be done (spoofing the person) ?

They may have a registered a domain, but may not have registered connected domains to it such as , aeronautics.org , or aeronautics, or you could go to another office for the company, find a person there, register a domain, and register email addresses belonging to a likely expected person to be at the other fake office. Send them an email to the target from the fake employee. You have time restrictions in terms of the domain.

You can see that the reconnaissance period takes a very long time. You can get a voice sample from something they recorded and publicly available. You can also get a sample of their writing style. If you can study the way the individual writes, or what language they use, that would be a great help. There has been a number of hacks all the time, where they would read emails between people, and understand their mannerisms and how they interact with each other. You would have to accurately create a convincing duplicate. 

If you have the organization approved, target individual approved, you would need to develop an online identity that would be convincing. You can not leave any breadcrumbs anywhere that ties you back to your real identity. Ron's early hacker name is "Shire", so if he wanted to post a blog on cyber-attacks based on activity, you can expect him to develop a different identity to do this. 

How do you avoid leaving breadcrumbs ?

1. Social media accounts have put a lot of effort in detecting bots or fake accounts. When establishing an account, it could raise alarm bells. 
2. Social media platforms will not allow you to establish an account via a VPN. 
3. Go somewhere in a public WIFI network that has no affiliation with your daily habits. 
4. They would check the phone numbers, all the information on the profile, and they would at times as you for official identification, pictures , etc. Maybe you can use a picture of a person that does not exist. Animated avatars no longer works. 
5. The  VPN should be outside of a five-eyes country (US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom). Avoid former Soviet block. They have to be bulletproof with zero logs. 
6. The account would need an email. Consider the same aspects in the VPN. No logging, preferably outside the five-eyes countries, bulletproof, does not share or store any information, and provides encrypted email service. Spam blocking at Meta may spot your Proton email. 
7. You have hypothetically established your account. How would you populate the friends list with people? Professionals create a number of fake accounts, and then have all the fake accounts friend each other. All the activities on the social media account ins tracked, and everything you do on there has to be consistent with the character created. If you have established a social media account, but you have not created any posts, or have no activity on the account, the target may suspect you instantly due to the lack of activity. Professionally you have to build these accounts shortly after graduation, and you have to maintain them. These accounts
8. Write down every aspect of social media personnas, such as emails, passwords, etc. 
9. If you have to go to the Dark Web five years from now, the phony identity has to have a history. 
10. Assume the adversaries will have more resources and have better experience in detecting fake accounts. 
11. The activities posted should not conflict with the persona. 
12. You can post information that will help convince the target, as for example, someone with a deep interest in aeronautics would have a profile page full of posts about aeronautics. You can not be on the fake social media account looking for a previous significant other. 
13. All the activity has to be consistent and has to have a history. 
14. Use **Incognito Browsing** all the time when doing this. It does not store the browsing histroy locally, but the websites you visited are visible at your Internet Service Provider's end. 
15. Assume your adversaries have access to your information.
16. Online journalists who write fiction : think who you are going to be!
17. Volunteer activities or anything that ties you together would help tremendously!
18. If you are close to their algorithm, the system may automatically connect you together. 
19. You are going after an industry that is constantly being attacked. They will be paranoid about the information they have. They will protect their secrets, and be on guard!
20. If you can achieve all the objectives of the assignment , such as establishing account, the first part of the assignment is the **Dosier**. If Ron asks, tell me about their family, and we do not know, we would lose points. The Dosier has to be as complete as possible.
21. You have to be able to find information about your target! If that is not possible, skip this target!
22. He is looking for *effort*! It does not have to be perfect, but there has to be effort!


#### What not to do ?

1. If a target is a PHD level at Materials Design, and the phony profile is an expert at Advanced Materials Design, you would be easily discovered. 
2. If you went to the same school they went to, you would be asked immediately.
3. If you posted that you lived at the same town you do, such as NYC, the target would be closely connected to other organizations in the same field. Your personality for example can be a first year business student who is interested in starting a business venture in the field, and that would be a good avenue to persue.
4. If a student created an account, and forget to log in via the VPN, and get detected that they are currently at NSCC, it would be a shame to get locked out!
5. Is there any mistake in the account? If you could not get the account, it is about practicing all the techniques involved. 
6. Do NOT contact the person!



#### Where do you use these techniques? 


Ideally, the online identity will not have any connection to you. If you are 20 years old, you would choose a 50 year old woman or man. The activities have to be consistent with your fake identity. 

There was a lot of people in North America that tried to identiy the January 6th attack!

1. Penetration Testing 
   
	   Managing these accounts are tedious. For penetration testing , your adversaries will not have resources to access your algorithm history. In the Dark Web investigations, it is a different story. 



We have about a month to do this. We should use the lab class on Friday mornings to work on this. Log in to Microsoft Teams remotely, and we will be marked as present. The industry meeting with iC2 will be moved to *January 17th* at 8:30AM. Ron will try to get individuals out of their Friday class. IC2 is doing a huge initiative to help us. 


We will be given time to work on this venture, and Ron will do this based on experience. We are expected to have the discipline to do this ahead of time. During class time, we will do materials from the course. 


We have :

1. Research assignment for Data Breaches
2. Network Configurations from December. 
   
   
   We will connect different pods together, where we would have to communicate with another team, and have the hardware configured in a way similar to the activity we did on packet tracer. We will get into IPSes and IDSes

    
##### Signaling

**Signaling** does NOT work in Cybersecurity. 



>[!todo]
We have :
>
>>1. Assignments with activities online (hands on), with lecture components on each item
>>1. We will have a couple of members of our class who will give guest lectures on the practical experience that we have from working with Ron. It is to give information that will impress other individuals pertaining to the Cybersecurity field.
>>2. Getting many of us employed. We should be looking now, and figure out which industry we belong to, and the geographical location where we would like to work. He wont be giving each of us a reference, as he will be putting his name on the line. We have three months left, and we will be watched closely this semester. Employers may contact Ron to inquire about us. There are certain things that can not be shared, such as negative reviews.

>[!hint]
>
>>We are looking at entrepreneurs with research capital, supply chains are a great target, such as "We make fuel cells that do this", "we are one of the few companies that specialize in this target". Number of employees can be 20-100. They could be forming a research on an important aspect that is of an interest to China. 

Intellectual Property : Something created/invented, semiconductor, any invention or creation that will be patented. A trade secret. If you are writing a software that controls the assembly line for controlling manufacturing.
