>Today's discussion is about the **No Disclosure Agreement**.

We are dealing with a penetration test for a real client. The **Non-Disclosure Agreement** is signed! 


Opting out is available from this project. Ron will hold sessions separate from the class for the people who are in, and excluding those who want out. Regardless, we are bound by the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement that we signed. 


We are required to keep the identity of the client, and the activities associated with it **confidential**. One of the benefits of doing a real penetration test is our ability to add it to the resume. NSCC has a few projects who are specialists in Penetration Testing, and they had quite a bit of challenges in terms of getting hired. Without the experience, employers are hesitant. 

>[!info]
>
>We **cannot** tell them who the client is .

>>[!resume addition]
>>
>>We could say on the resume : 
>>
>>Jan.-March 2025 - Penetration Testing Team 
>>
>>`We did open source intelligence, USB drops, social engineering, Phishing campaigns, and more. If they are looking for verification, they can contact Ron`. 


The client has agreed to **conducting open-source intelligence operations**. We would use Google Hacking and oSINT to look at employees of the organization, directors, advisors, or anyone that would have a digital connection inside the organization. This is done to : 

1. Craft Phishing emails 
2. Late next week, or the week after , Tyler will talk to us about how he used OSINT work to craft Phishing work for a client over Christmas. He can talk to us about the techniques and how he crafted a customized Phishing campaign.
3. Possibly a **Physical Penetration Test**. 
   
>[!warning]
   >
   >>Do NOT enter the grounds of the organization. You can walk by it or drive by it !


#### Conflict of Interest 


If you have a family member supported indirectly by this organization, or if you have a connection to them, this would cause complications. We are to disclose this to Ron after the project starts. 


>[!important]
>
>We will meet the client on **Friday**. Only the *Executive Director - Stephanie* and the *Data Director - Josh*. Everyone in the organization knows they are getting a Cybersecurity assessment, and they will get training afterwards. 


Ron recommended for the client to *not* disclose the assessment with anyone, or maybe if it becomes a problem, to lie to the staff and tell them it has forgone the test for this year. This is because human beings change their behavior if they know if they are *being watched*.
We are not there to embarrass them. 

 #### Sock Puppets Assignment 


Dealing with a real client is vastly different compared to dealing with the **Sock Puppets Assignment**. We are not to contact the Sock Puppet target, but there is a chance we will contact our client. 


We are looking at : 

1. What they are doing *outside* of work : 
   
	   1. Are they on teams ?
	   2. Are they a part of a group?
	   3. Is there a regular activity that they do?
	   4. If they like hiking as a group, check out the hiking trails around them, and send them a survey pertaining to their favorite hiking trails. They are more likely to read the email and click on the link. 
	5. `Supply Chain attacks are great!`
	6. `If the email is targeted at the individual and their interest, they may not tell anyone about it. They may not check with someone because clicking on the email conflicts with using their systems for outside-work purposes`. 


How do we know this type of information ? 


>[!todo]
>
>We have to be working on the **Sock Puppet Assignment**, because we will be assessed on our precautions, we have to be prepared to answer specific questions about our target. 
>Questions could be asked : 
>
>>1. Which school does their son go to? 
>>2. Did their son get married?
>>3. What did you find out about them?

>[!important]
>
>Start looking at our target organization . Look at their employees , look at the articles they published online, and other information. Most of the employees do not know this will take place. 

> [!note]

> **Boshoron** is an entity hired by NSCC to send Phishing emails. 

>[!priorities]
>
>1. The Sock Puppet Assignment
>2. OSINT Work on HCSC.ca

>[!danger]

>If you write notes on the Penetration Test, keep it in a separate notebook, and lock it up in a safe!
>
>If you write digital notes, encrypt the notebook, and make sure you write the password.

>[!precautions]
>To do the work, have an external USB drive, with an encrypted VM on it with a password, and have a second password after launching the virtual machine!

>[!important]

>Meeting is Friday at 1:30 PM! The Agreement is expected to be signed next week!

>[!steps]
>
>>[!Penetration Test Planned Steps ( for HCSC.ca )]
>>1. Open Source Intelligence : Build Profiles, and provide the results from the OSINT research
>>2. Crafting Spear-Phishing Emails
>>3. Embedding malicious links and files in the Phishing emails. 
>>4. Establish a Command and Controll Server
>>5. Make malicious USB drives for the USB drop. 
>>6. Bonus : Physical penetration test. 

We will also be : 

1. Enumerating their website
2. Wireless sniffing test
3. Gain entry through a publicly-facing server
4. Refrain from conducting any actions that would cause **damages**. 


#### What type of actions would you do to **Ex-Filtrate Data** ? 

1. Port 80
2. DNS
3. Network Time Protocol


Every TCP/IP packet as an unassigned field for experimental actions. You can take a simple packet of any protocol and probably will not get noticed by anyone examining the packet. 


>[!note]
External penetration testing means *we have no right to be there*. We would acquire privileges if they allow us. 
>
Internal penetration testing means we would be given permission to conduct actions.

>[!danger]
>
>No contact. No penetrative work. Do NOT enter the grounds of their faculity. If we have public access rights in the building, that is fine. You can go for a drive by the building if you wish. 

>[todo] 
>
>You should have **Sock Puppet Accounts** on the following platforms : 
>
>>1. LinkedIn 
>>2. Facebook
>>3. Twitter/X
>>4. (TruthSocial -> Trump's Social Network)
