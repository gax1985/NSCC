Prior to entering an engagement, you would be required to sign a **Non-Disclosure Agreement** and **IP Waiver**. If you are working for Ron, and he is doing a penetration test to the client : 


1. Any information discovered about the client, as we will be finding vulnerabilities and gathering proprietary information, we need to keep them confidential 
2. IP Waiver : if you develop a tool or a technique during the project, the technique or tool is the property of the client


Ron has a meeting with a client next week. He would like to do as many real projects as possible. He has two options : 

1. Make the Penetration Test as a part of the course , where we would learn advanced techniques during a penetration test. During this assignment, a NDA and IP waivers are required.
2. Make it a work term project: We would also have to sign the NDA and IP Waivers. 


Over the next two days, read the **NDA and IP Waiver Notes** document. If you have something you object to, he may still give it as a part of the course, and those individuals who do not wish to sign it would have a different assignment. 

If a lot of people would not sign it, he would make it a work term. 


The presentation part is not expected of us. He would like us to see how those workshops happen. This includes what the clients say, and the discussions of the room. There are a lot more things that happen during those meetings. 

If we are willing to sign it, send Ron an email indicating your preference. 



We have some readings to do ( NDA , IP waiver, Attack Surface Reduction Rules ). It is well worth the read, as the NDA and IP waivers are essential, and the Attack Surface Reduction Rules are key to knowing how to secure a Windows system. 


Representatives from industry would like us to receive training in ethics. Can we name a time in our professional practice where we were ethically-challenged. 



We live in dangerous times. He advocates joining the army. When he graduated from TUNS, he considered it, and there was a condition of going back to study at TUNS for four more years. If you are in your early 20s, you can retire when you are 50 with full benefits.


# Ethics


Ron would like us to set the Cybersecurity mind to one side. This is a challenge for Ron, as it usually takes two months, but he will do it in two lectures. It is unlike any IT training we have received. Ethics is about who we are as persons. We talk about it because anyone in this industry will have multiple experiences when they are ethically-challenged. It is about a decision of doing something ethical and losing your job, or having to attend court cases. The decision has to be made by yourself. You can reflect on your personal life where you would do something you know to be wrong. The latter aspect has to do with whether you would do this thing or not. Ron likes to get counter-intelligence training connected to this point, as he had to get this done every year. He mentioned that we would have to assume that the other side is doing things actively against our side. Thus, there may be times where you would consider doing something unethical as a part of the job. 



It is not about what others tell you is right or wrong, or whether what you think is right or wrong. It is not hard to imagine how this could arise in this profession, especially when doing intelligence work, which means that the information you collect does not go to trial, and you do not have to worry about breaking a law when having to go inside a physical building to get information or set up a MiTM as a part of the assignment. The problem is everyone has inherit rights of privacy, and we will use our skills to violate this right. It could be about lying, manipulating people, and other actions such as that. We would have to think about how we feel about that. It is not good making it along the path when it happens. It might be a moment's notice to decide. The way of fighting your way through that is to make a plan , remain mindful of your plan, and executing your plan. The purpose of this type of training is to get you comfortable with this plan. It is about recognizing who you are as an individual. When your boundaries are challenged, you do not have to sit and decide for too long. 


Consider the ICBM crew, where there would be two officers there with two keys to launch the missle. A lot of psychological and ethical training is done for these two officers. A scenario of one of the officers having an affair with the other officer's wife could affect their actions. These officers will not sit and think their ethics at that time. Ron recalls seeing a study in Vietnam where the kill rates of the Americans was horrible when it comes to defending against attacks. They thought about the reasons, and it turned out that individual soldiers are firing into the air or missing intentionally. If they fired into the trees, everyone will think they are good people and still participating. 


We want to take some time to dive into who we are as people. This is all about YOU. We need to look at these problems and situations starting from a high level and digging down to recognizing our *framework*. Your management may include to take yourself out of the situation and not getting into it. In human history, there has been 5 species of humans. *Homo Sapiens* is the only one left. The other 4 are gone. How come we are the only ones left? if we can go back in time, and take a baby from 75000 years ago, and take it to our times, chances are we will not tell the difference. Biologically, we are still the same machine. Since we genetically mixed with the other species, let us movie it 40000 years. Humans from that time will do some thinking and doing exactly in the same way we do. There might be someone with a spear throwing it higher in order not to kill the other guy. If we process the questions Ron will ask us, everything that we ask ourselves will be asked 40000 years ago. 

Think of an ethical person , what words would describe them : 

1. Integrity 
2. Empathy
3. Moral
4. Truthful / Honest 
   
   >[!note]
   >
   >**Are we fundamentally-honest people ?**
   >
   >... No

We lie routinely, such as saying we are fine when asked how we are , or lying when a significant other asks us if clothes make them look fat. We lie a lot as a species. Lying is done to : 

1. Get accepted in the group : We are social animals. We like to be accepted into the group. Isolation is torture to human beings ; we need interactions with others. Being a part of the group was essential to survival, and it is genetically programmed into us. We lie for survival. When Ron was a kid, he was challenged from both perspectives. Ron lived in a troubled neighborhood. He needed to lie to be accepted in the group, and to be protected. There were no good folks to chose from. We understand we *sometimes* have to lie. Focus on **if we are truthful with ourselves**. The worst anxiety comes when you lie to yourself. Ron knew when existing there that he was *not* the type of immoral individual, or being dishonest with himself. He knew he did not belong there. He knew the whole thing was wrong. He got out of that neighborhood quickly. This is one of the reasons he survived unto his current age. As we go forward when considering your ethical framework, Ron asks us *not to lie to ourselves*, because if we do, we would end up in a terrible situation, and be forced to make a decision what we do not want to make. A Secrecy Oath might mean to commit to something verbally, but mentally, you could decide Secret Evasion of Mind. As you consider these principles, please refrain from doing a *Secret Evasion of Mind* with yourself. Back to 40000 years, everyone was the same. They had the same ethical frameworks as you. Using this timeframe, and taking it to the past 100 years,

   ...In the Industrial Revolution era, can you think of something every human would consider fundamentally wrong or evil?  

Class Input : 

1. Murder : 
   
   If someone points a gun at your face, and they will shoot you, is it ok to kill them ? 
   
   If you know someone will murder your children, would you agree to giving them your children willingly?
   
   There were a lot of brain diseases called Prions that persist through cooking. It is from the spine. There was a disease rampent in the South Pacific, and after doing Anthropological studies, they noticed that they eat their elders to conserve their knowledge. It is important to understand that anyone that professes that there is a universal right and wrong has not done their homework. 
   
   We have societal Ethical Frameworks that is given to us from the outside world. It has characteristics that are **temporal** and **spatial**.  Here is the textbook definition of 

Ethical Decision : In every circumstance, it is any decision or action that makes the situation better. Any decision or action that does not make it better, it is considered unethical. 

If we have a blue marker, and it is the marker allowed to be used on blue board. Someone else has a pencil, and the decision to take their pencil is unethical. The reason  : 


think of the sptial perspective that a bubble surrounds you, and includes all the people who would be affected by the decision, consider how they would be affected them. If the bubble includes just ourselves, it may improve OUR situation, but the moment we include the other individual in who would be affected, it changes the action to immoral. FORTUNE 500 leaders often keep the bubble only to include themselves, and sometimes they include their family, and they fit in the Archetype of a Sociopath. Anything that impacts them is bad, anything that restrains their actions is bad. We as a society have troubles with the diameter of this bubble. Sometimes this bubble would selectively allow people based on beliefs, sexual orientation , different religion, etc ... This is a problematic view, and it leads to dissention and problems within your community. Generally-speaking, for the system to work, we have to have a minimal impact on society from individual decisions, and if we do have a major impact from individuals, this is a terrible situation. Thus , a set of rules are needed to cut down on life's disasters, such as having the whole societal system break down. The rules have to be *straightforward*, and *keep their numbers minimal*. What kind of rules would we have to maintain a stable society, and what actions cause discontent? 

1. Murder
2. Theft
3. Slavery  

It is important to remember that an **Enforcer** is needed to make people follow these rules. Some individuals may live beyond these boundaries of ethics. Thus, the enforcer in our times became the law givers of the Police, Army etc. For human beings, this rule was necessary until they reached 21 , why ? higher brain functions that can process ethical questions, and the understanding , does not develop until the brain is 21 years old. A 7-year old may not understand or be able to comprehend that this action is unethical. They would have to maintain the idea of ALWAYS watching you. This would lead to them not conducting this action. If someone is always fearful, and reminded that they will be punished for their actions. Thus, the role of a **Watcher** was created. The persons may fear the negative consequences, and that could cause them to refrain, but making them feel they are always watched would further prevent them. 


Slavery is no longer acceptable in our society. If you fly 16 hours across the world, you are likely to see horrible injustices towards women, and their diminished status of equality, or being considered property. We accept we can not deal with injustices in other parts of the world, and we have a subconcious desire of expanding this bubble to other individuals in the world. How would things change? This leads us to  :


Temporal : We often run into individuals who were of a different sexual preference, and you knew about them, how many of us would keep their secret knowing that they will face dire consequences? 

Every society has practiced slavery at some point in their history. How does the temporal factor works ? it works based on **Morality**.


**Morality** is based on a function. We , from programming, know what functions do. We take the ethical frameworks that existed, processed them, and then determined whether we agree with them or not. If we do not agree with them, we do things like lie to get by. If , in due time, enough people do not agree with this ethical frameworks, change happens. Then, society drops the subject matter in question from their ethical framework. 

Morality is **the output of the function of YOU processing the ethical framework**. This is why there is **not a universal Right or Wrong**. 


Let us look at some possible frameworks to chose from ( there are many ... due to Ethical Philosophers needing to come up with frameworks to stay current as Ethical Philosophers) : 

1. Deontology : Deon is the root word for Duty in the Greek Language. This translates to "You have been given rules to follow, and you are not allowed to come up with any other". You rely on a set of rules given to you by some figure/s of authority or society. You have to follow those rules, and there is no derivation of these rules. They are immutable. We like to play with the boundaries, so we might deal with something akin to ...
   
2. Consequenstialism : it looks at each action, and assesses the consequences of one decision over the other decision. This is often referred to as "*The End Justifies The Means ...*". If we need food to survive, knowing that this will break Deontology rules, but survival is a must, and thus I should choose to steal . 

3. Utilitarianism : What is the proscribed Utility of the Action? We can measure goodness and badness in Business Planning with Profits and Losses. We can produce something not repairable, profits go up and losses go down. This is the only way a business assesses right and wrong. Businesses have no conscious mind, and you could say without a soul. 
   
   Is it better to torture a terrorist to death even if we do not know if they are in fact terrorists, or whether we do not know if they know the information we need to save lives? 
   
   *Needs of the Many outweighs the needs of the few* ...
   
   
   
   
   Applied Ethics  has four principles : 
   
  I. Non-Mafeisance : 
  
	  *Do No Harm* ... I will harm no one. You see this in Medicine, Law, etc. 

  II. Benificence : 
  
	  I will do *good* to others. I will be charitable, and care for the sick and the hungry. 
  
  III. Autonomy : 
  
	  *Every Person gets to make their own decisions, and you should not violate autonomy*. Teachers always get the question : "Should I do this or that?". The instructor's role is to share knowledge, but should refrain from definitively giving them a recommendation on a course of action. If the person is doing self-harm, it is required for the instructor to declare it, and it is the only violation to autonomy. Does your spouse have a right to punish you for doing a course of action ? 
 
 IV. Justice : 
 
	 Most people can not define it. Justice says that *every person in society participates equally in the costs and benefits of that society*. If they do not contribute to making the bread, they can not eat the bread. If they pay their taxes, they get to benefit from the public spending. Everyone has the right for food , shelter and other services in society. Universal Income Plans have been around for a while. They were proposed by two senators and the champion of it was an ultra-conservative proponent. Based on where you live, you receive a monthly cheque for the amount necessary for you to cover your living costs. This is around 2000 CAD in Halifax. Everyone gets it. Every adult receives it. Where it has been practiced, what do you think the results are? remarkably positive! It turns out that in the societies that implement it, the percentage of individuals who use it to become non-contributing members are about 5%. This number has nothing to do with the system. Education goes up in this system, due to everyone being able to go back to school now due to them not having to work. Startups spring out of the city in large numbers. Volunteerism goes up too, as everyone has time to contribute.  Arts and Culture gets widely adopted too, and people go after their passions. In terms of net cost for the government, it goes down significantly. It has been piloted in Canada, and in order to get it, they put certain rules on getting it, which defeats the idea. In a Universal Income system, you do not have unemployment insurance anymore. %75 of every dollar in a social finance system goes towards making this program run, and they get effectively 25 centers of that dollar. You lose a lot of funds. The amount of funds in a universal income that reach the pockets of every citizen increases, and program costs go down. This is not adopted because the number of employees that work for the current programs would lose their jobs, and thus would likely to vote against politicians who got them to lose their jobs. 



There is a system that Ron was taught that prescribed horrible physical punishments , and they were all metaphors. If that is not who you are, maintaining the guilt throughout your physical life, this is inflecting horrible tortures on your brain. You will feel so bad for the rest of your life making it equivalent to the horrible physical torture in hell. If you have overiding guilt, it could be due to not being honest with ourselves.
