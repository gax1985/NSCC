#### The **Sock Puppets'** Assignment


ISEC 3077 Assignment 1, Attack Vectors and Techniques  
Sock Puppets  
Issued Date: January 8, 2025. Due date: February 7, 2025  
Preamble  
To avoid detection during the reconnaissance phase of a Security Assessments, Investigations and Pen  
Testing it is beneficial to protect your identity on-line. One method of doing this is to create “sock  
puppet” accounts. These are false on-line accounts that you can use to mask your identity. In addition to  
their use for security testing, this technique is also used by cyber criminals for the same purpose. The  
best way to understand a technique is to do it.  
Requirements  
Step 1 – Identify a Target  
Locate a Small-to-medium size business in the US that may hold sensitive data that a hacker would want.  
Consider industries that China (for example) is targeting:  
(1) aerospace/aeronautic equipment, (2) high-end railway, (3) agriculture, (4) new materials, (5) medical  
equipment and biomedicine, (6) digital controls and robotics, (7) electric cars and energy vehicles, (8)  
information technology, (9) power equipment, and (10) ocean engineering.  
You must have your target approved by your instructor.  
Find one that provides information on its website about the senior employees. Choose an employee  
(your Target) that you think would have access to the data.  
You must have your Target approved by your instructor.  
This could be an executive or support person. Then use OSINT to find out more about this person. Recall  
your introduction to OSINT last year. You must use a VPN and Incognito browsing while doing this step.  
Build a profile on your victim including as much information as possible and a picture. The profile of your  
target will be one page of your submission.  
WARNING: AT NO TIME IN THIS ASSIGNMENT ARE YOU TO EVER  
CONTACT YOUR TARGET. THIS IS A THEORECTICAL EXERCISE.  
Step 2 – Build an Identity  
Now it is time to build a fake on-line identity (your Sock Puppet) that may be someone that your victim  
would communicate with. Points to consider when considering your Target and your Sock Puppet may  
be:  
• Same age or different  
• Same Gender Identity or different  
• Same ethnicity or different  
• Same religion or different

• Same political persuasion or different  
• Same Interests and/or volunteer activities or different  
• Same sexual orientation or different  
• Etc.  
Here are some things you should NOT do (you will lose points if you do):  
When considering your Target and your Sock Puppet, they should NOT have the same:  
• Town/City/State – Be careful that your Target did not (for example) grow-up in or go-to-school  
in your Sock Puppet’s location.  
• Educational Background and Definitely Not the same schools  
The trick is to find a match between their speciality and yours without you having to fake knowledge  
that you don’t have. The following example is paraphrased from a previous student’s assignment:  
Example: Your target is a Chemical Researcher, and your Sock Puppet is an entrepreneur with no science  
background who wants to start a business making home beauty products (soap or skin cleanser based on  
herbal mixtures).  
Your Sock Puppet has a life that matches them.  
For the purposes of this assignment, you are to create false social media accounts that cannot be traced  
back to you. This exercise is intended for you to discover the success and pitfalls in developing these  
accounts. (i.e. expect to get locked out – Challenge: can you avoid this?)  
IMPORTANT NOTE 1: IN ALL STEPS BELOW, WHENEVER POSSIBLE, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS USE  
INCOGNITO BROWSING TO AVOID COOKIES. YOU WILL ALSO DO ALL ACTIVITY RELATED TO YOUR  
FALSE ACCOUNT FROM A SEPARATE VM AND NO-LOGGING VPN.  
IMPORTANT NOTE 2: RECORD ALL USERNAMES, PASSWORDS, EMAILS, IDENTITIES, FALSE AGES, FALSE  
BIRTHDATES ETC.; YOU WILL FORGET THEM.  
VPN  
All of your activities on-line should be masked through the use of a VPN. But you probably won’t be able  
to establish certain Social Network accounts using a VPN. Instead, choose a public wireless network to  
do your work from so your activity can’t be traced back to your IP address. You should access free VPN  
software that you can use for this assignment.  
Task 1 - Email  
Most on-line accounts require an email address. You are to access free on-line email services to create a  
false email identity (to be used for social media accounts). As an added layer of protection, you should  
use an encrypted email service and/or a bullet proof provider (eg. does not share information). The  
name attached to these accounts might or might not be your exact Sock Puppet name. The names  
should be designed to not attract attention. Whenever possible, do not use information that can be tied  
to you (other emails, Nickname, phone numbers, hometown etc.). Change your age and other  
identifying information. Only provide (false) minimal information and make each account as secure and

private as possible. Never attach a picture unless it is required; in which case use an avatar image that  
does not look like you if the provider will accept it or a solution of your own design.  
Task 2 – Social Media  
Using the above information, establish false social media accounts in Facebook, X and LinkedIn. If one of  
these proves impossible you may substitute another on approval from your instructor. The names  
attached to these accounts should be designed to not attract attention. Whenever possible, do not use  
information that can be tied to you (other emails, Nick-name, phone numbers, hometown etc.). Change  
your age and other identifying information. Only provide (false) minimal information and make each  
account as secure and private as possible. Never attach a picture unless it is required; in which case use  
an avatar image that does not look like you if the provider will accept it or a solution of your own design.  
Submission Guidelines  
You MUST get your instructor’s approval at each step where required as noted above.  
The assignment will be evaluated based on demonstration to your instructor of each completed task.  
Rubric  
This assignment is worth 25% of your final mark and it is scored out of 40 points using the following  
rubric.  
Please note that a pass is 60% (24 points) and if all categories are “Condition Somewhat Met” then you  
can only score a maximum of 20 points and will therefore not receive a passing grade.

## Types of Sock Puppets



#### Concern Puppets

>They pose as *true believers*, but occasionally spread doubt to instill doubt.



#### Strawman Puppets


>[!definition]
>
>They pose as *true believers*, but would issue foolish arguments which are *easily disputed*.




#### Meat Puppets

>What is **Astroturfing**? 
>
>>[!definition]
>>
>>Astroturfing refers to a form of advocacy or propaganda where a group or individual attempts to create the impression that a grassroots movement or spontaneous display of public opinion is actually the result of deliberate and artificial manipulation, often by a government, corporation, or organization. This can be achieved through various means such as paying individuals to participate in online discussions, rallies, or petitions, creating fake social media accounts or personas, or using other forms of disinformation to create the illusion that there is widespread support for a particular cause or policy.


## Purposes :


1. Promotions : 

    I. Companies/Company
    II. Posting reviews
    III. Political Commentary
    IV. Foreign Espionage (Psychological operations - PsyOps - Operation Earnest Voice)
    VI. Create a Honey Pot : Cuckoo's Egg Movie - Creation of false information to keep the hacker in the system long enough to be spotted
    
    Operation Earnest Voice 
    
    
    
## Requirements : 


1. Character needs to have all the components of real life.
2. No Connection at all with the **Sock Puppet**
3. Separation of equipment and programs used. A separate dedicated machine with minimum software to minimize the attack surface. 
4. Associated equipment should not be traceable to you at all. 
5. For any of our activities, we would use cash or prepaid credit cards. You can not order something with your credit card for your campaign (Mint Mobie SIM cards). 
6. Probing tools to find out if someone is checking you out. 
7. VPN : choose provider outside the five eyes(legistlative jurisdiction). Check the IP address to make sure it gets randomized every time, which is a new IP for each connection. Use a public network, such as
a library/coffee shop.
8. Choose an Encryption-enabled mail provider (bulletproof provider, like fastmnail)
9. Choose application domains that are suitable (Telegram, Twitter, etc.)
10. Burner Phones 
11. Choose software that limit tracking and data, such as OSes, Browsers and Browser Extensions
12. Pictures must be believable and not taken from a real person. 
13. Friends : if you have a person of a particular demographic in a particular domain (character has a life in the pharmaceutical industry. If you have a friend in class whose family member is dying, you can include them if it helps you, and they withstand checking)


## What not to do : 

1. Duplicate data
2. Duplicate IP addresses
3. Wrong time zone ( if we tell the target it is bed time when the time zone is different ...)
4. Mentioning the wrong weather and wrong information.
5. Linguistic Analyssis : Use automated tools for **Text N-Gram**. Our Canadian accent is similar to Washington state. You can easily think they are from Nova Scotia. How can you make yourself sound like someone else in written communication? We can use ChatGPT to make our written communications sound like a different accent. Differences can be differences with **English/American spelling**. A lot of the younger generation are used to communicating with chat systems. It is friendly, funny, casual, involves emogiis, etc. That tone is entering communications outside the realm of chat (Thumbs Up!). It carries over from chat to written language. If the Sock Puppy is from New Orleans, where the character is from a French Ancestry. Ask "Re-write as an elderly person from New Orleans". Have we seen any of the issue of a Strip Club in Vancuuver where they posted " Our Neighpours were never Neighbours". Twitter (X) decided this was hate-speech. Run everything through ChatGPT.
