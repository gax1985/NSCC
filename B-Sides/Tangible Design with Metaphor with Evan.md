We will step into the *Woodshop*. Experience is not necessary. Draw paraboles in reference to our interests and hobbies, and we start to see how everything fits together. 


It is not about a checklist, or a new tool as we have many already, but hopefully it will help us in identifying patterns.

Woodworking was a new hobby. You get a lot of extra wood shards. 



Service Contract between components --> Collaboration/Integration/Collaboration. 


Jig --> Form of automation allowing squaring up a wood board

How is a Jig different from a template ? -> Jig lead to repeatable actions, templates bring repeatable shapes. 


# Design 


Nails are *not* a strategy. 


When discussing design, are we talking about urban design, industrial design .etc ?


They are all doing the same thing : 

Take a Process to find out how Constraints+Purpose  = Design

True creativeity happens when you solve a problem within a set of constraints. 

Carpenters take pieces of wood, twist them, bend them and interact with them in so many ways. Ultimately, they do not pick the board due to them *thinking* of an outcome to satisfy. When thinking about this, you are not picking up a joint that looks nice. 

How the users interact is very important, but keep in mind how would change be with time, with increased workloads and so on. 


## Secure Design 

OWASP talks about secure and insecure design. 

Design is not just for designers, architects , the business, etc ...

if you make decisions about how something works, you are involved in design.

Secure Design is not on the OWASP list. It is just **Good Design**. 

Security needs to be treated the same way. 


Security + Nails = Un-passable gate


We mistake activity for progress. 

We go to put things together, but the pieces no longer fit. 

We get caught in feature-factory mindset, where Agile means constant production. 

There is a lack of checks and balances about wants and needs. 

We can build a perfect component in isolation, but forget about integrating it with the larger purpose. 

Design is about Slowing Down and Exploring and Playing and Being Wrong ...

"Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating. An Ability to play, and to play is to experiment. What if the essence of openness, being ok with whatever happens. You can not be playful if you have an idea of something you should not do"  --> Quote 

One of the biggest reason of grabbing the nailgun is the deep-seated habit of rewarding the wrong things. How many have teams of building backlogs of output? The outcomes may flow naturally if the data is ok. The problem is service backlog, feature request, vulnerability backlogs and so on. 

If you are buying a coffee table, would you consider " Have they used screws inside ?" most likely, we would not be looking at the tasks that went into the creation, but the *outcomes*.

Outcomes are the reason that companies thrive. 

Instead of vulnerabilities closed, we should look at "Have we helped the users unto better safety?" 

How can we tell if a project may not have a fully-secure design ?  

There is no mention of tradeoffs, edges, and so on. Everything is " ... it depends". 


 How do we notice something systemic being wrong, and how can we put it back on track? 

## Building Design Intuition 

1. Pause before you cut the wood --> When doing something over and over again, this is when the issue happens.  
2. Embrace all constraints --> Some of the constraints will be a huge source of worry, due to a functional foundation being missing. 
3. Celebrate Outcomes, not just *Output*. We need to think like a builder, and think about the purpose. Does the rest of the business care if the solution is secure? they only care when there is a breach. When you start thinking about the business' context, other teams appear in the periphery. How would it affect the rest of the team ? does your security design make peoples' lives worse ? change the design.Shift the focus of the celebrations of doing your job to meet a deadline to celebrating the increase the adoption of an important security feature. Celebrate more failures than successes, because it means we are *actually* trying.
4. Find your Analogy. Find a way to reach them by speaking their language. 

# Heart of the Shop 

In the center of the workflow is the *Heart of the Shop*, like a Table Saw will determine where you place your workbench, your dust collection, etc. It is the Anchor that you should be using to compare all the other tools you are picking up. 

What is your core foundational system? 

What is the heart of the shops for Developers ? -> IDE

When you identify the Heart of the Shop, you can start taking into account the function of the tool. Can you work to bring security to them, to the heart of the process ? You build your processes to build their system. 

You will trust it at the end of the day. 


To progress further, there is a saying "Invest in what matters ..."

You invest in high-quality reliable table saws up front, as if you are constantly switching, problems come out of the woodwork. 

Example : A company's entire automation was lead by Service Now. The CFO of the company decided to not renew their contract due to a personal problem with them. The investment into the heart of the shop is due to the tool being the right tool for the job, and gives us the most leverage it can possibly provide. 

There are additional factors that will give you this leverage. 

Look to the tools you already have! See if you can build something on top of what we already have. 

A well-used table saw does create a natural byproduct : Sawdust! Sawdust indicates the shop is busy ... we logs, events, metrics , and they are all byproducts of the systems we use. 

This sawdust will clog the air and attack the lungs. This necessitates the cleanup of the shop. If the logs are piling up, we have health hazards, alert fatigue, loss of trust in the system , and becomes a needle in a haystack if you wish to find something. 

Spend a few minutes every day as a break from work mode to tidy up the shop. Take noisy signals and tune it up. Place something higher on the urgency spectrum. 


## Warning Signs. 

If you see the following symptoms : 

1. Frequent Context Switching
2. Integration Fatigue ?
3. Fatigue in Documents? 


Strategies : 
1. Identify the Tablesaw! Discussing the top 3 tools that people would resign if they went missing  with the team. 
2. Make a technical drawing --> Diagrams are great. Map out the current tools, how they connect to each other, which data flows between them, security practices for the tools, etc. You can start threat modelling small, and make it grow bigger and bigger. 
3. Clean up the shop! Even if we look at the process and fix it, we need to know the Constraints imposed upon us by raw materials. Lumber has a grain going through them. We need to select the lumber, looking at them for vulnerabilities like mositure content, we need to understand the grain and size. Grain is the natural wood fibre. If the tool is used to cut against the grain, it would warp the tool. Moisture like MissioncriticalUSBSticks is dangerous, as it builds up (it is the shortcuts taken, the unreliable foundations we opt to use). If we do something against the grain metaphorically for another team, we see security tearout (they would be less likely to adopt secure practices). 

Why do we take out thinking about the source materials when deciding  on and designing security solutions ? 

The posture differences between teams, like marketing and finance, both could be less technical. Not every component carries equal risk. There are systems that hold important financial data. 

Often we delegate responsibility. The hardwood supplier or the sawmill are to blame for quality/safety issues. 

Security is everyone's job!

Teams should not be an afterthought. If we proceed towards the accomplishment of a task, we do not ship it half-completed. It invites opportunities for hammer and nails, instead of adopting secure-by-design aesthetics. 

Quality and Security is everyone's Responsibility. 

You will see Tool Adoption Failures. 

There is a culture of *...Forcing It!*


The tool should not be work. It is the process. 

Context is king, as if you have wood with high-moisture, the moisture will evaporate and the wood will bend and change. It is great for carving a spoon, and it is very bendable. The defect will become a feature, and becomes a unique part of its overall structure. 

Establish criticality for your systems and data, as classification provides context. We can make smarter decisions, and we do not have to build Correlation systems.  

To get better at adapting, do User Testing! It will provide powerful insights, and see if it works for them. Do progressive deployments where you can see if the tool is getting stuck. 

For the Adversarial-minded, know when to go against the grain! The blade is dangerous, as if you move the router in the same direction where you are spinning, you can have the blade come off. If you master it, it will prevent cutouts, and new opportunities for innovation. 

 Dimensional Lumber like 2X4 is not 2X4. Every time a tape measure is grabbed, it creates a Margin of Error. Is the same tape measure being used? Are you measuring in inches or cms ... ? It creates opportunities for mistakes. 

You do not invent a Jig for the task at hand. You measure, test , observe, make mistakes, make firewood, and distill what you learned. You do not copy your prototype only. You build a Jig to automate!

It is not about Automation for automation's sake, but about embedding design, constraints and purpose unto a Process !
