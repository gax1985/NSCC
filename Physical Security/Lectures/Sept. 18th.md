As the course proceeds, we will look in more detail about Risk Management. 


Ron would like to talk to us about the NIST Risk Management Formula. Speak to Laura and her team, as they hire individuals with interest in NIST Risk Management. Check the Brightspace course shell for the document that Ron will add involving the subject. 


In Canada, separate platforms were used, but NIST is becoming the replacement endorsed by the Canadian Government



# ISO 27001


It is an audit of security practices. if you are a business considering selling into a government client, or anything your security posture may determine the suitability of your business, often interested organizations will insist in being certified for ISO 27001, which covers Physical and Cyber Security of an institutions. 


Ron mentioned someone he knew of an organization next to the ocean that was interested in ISO 27001 certification. You should be familiar with ISO 27001. 


NIST has a separate Cybersecurity framework separate from their other frameworks. 


The major change for the NIST review is the inclusion of Suppliers, who must cooperate with the audits. 


Supply Chain attacks tend to be done by highly-skilled attachers, other states or sophisticated cyber criminals. 

Ron mentioned an incident involving cyber attackers interested in the RSA encryption of the US military. Years ago, if you wanted to compress your files, you had to use WINZIP. You could have a free 30-day trial period. It was a major hurdle to go through the 30-day trial period. a Printers' supplies company would offer their clients via their website the ability to send ink automatically as well as printing supplies. On their website, they did a promotion where they offered a program that compresses your files to avoid the hurdle of WinZIP. The program had terrible security. 
The RSA encryption key was the goal. Attackers broke into the company's website, and in the Downloads section, added their malware. One of the customers was a client of a company that had the RSA encryption. Via the Zip file, they would gain access to the target company, and after monitoring them for two years, they managed to get through RSA's company. Eventually, they located the RSA encryption key in use by the US military, and with that key, they were able to compromise their communications. 

Because of this, NIST insisted on including the Supply Chain. In 1979, Ron worked for a company in Vancuuver selling parts. One of their customers had a minimum stocking level of the bits they use frequently. Ron was able with a Telex machine to log in into the company's network, and take down the inventory situation of the company. This is before cyber supply chain attacks were common. Ink and Toner Paper supply company would gain access to their client's network, and then send in the parts or products that were getting low. 


We discussed Huawei's device, which were sold to many Canadian and American government organizations, until it was discovered that they were controlled by the PLA (China), and used this equipment to monitor communications. Canada was the last of the five eyes countries to disallow Huawei equipment in there in 2022.  



More recently, we had the **Solarwinds Attack**. This was devastating, because Solarwinds was everywhere monitoring cyber threats. The attack was in 2021, and before that , NSCC used Solarwinds. In terms of auditing the Supply Chain, how they did it was to get into the update server, and compromised the automated update to compromise all US government institutions using SolarWinds. The password on the update server was "password". 

What Ron found most common is the password for admin account is the same default password that these devices had on shipment. If you know the default passwords, you are in good shape!


Supply Chain attacks continue to this day, evident in the latest Hezbollah's Pager attacks. 


Hezbollah used pagers because two and a half years ago, they had orders to get rid of all cellphones, due to the Israeli intelligence agencies using Geolocation on their cellphones. The communique that they had ordering cellphones to be discarded was most likely intercepted. 


### Spply Chain Attacks


Long Term
Very patient
Highly skilled attackers, most likely nation states or organized cyber criminals
Final Goal : Identify/Eliminate members of Hezbollah




The more valuable the target = the more skilled the attacker will be 



if you are protecting something valuable, assume your opponent is more resourceful, more knowledgeable and better prepared than YOU!


Institutions hire and fire people all the time, and the high turnover rate would make things easier for attackers to infiltrate institutions. 


Ron thought the true intention is to *identify them*, where to account where are those injuries reported!


We want to become intimately familiar with the NIST Frameworks, which include : 


## NIST's Common Controls 


There are 1200 of them. 

Someone will compare your practices to each one of these common controls. Not all controls apply to all industries, but you may have a huge number of controls matching some on their Common Controls 


### Access Control

Username/Password
Password Policies
MFA/no MFA
Remote Access
VPN ?

#### Sub-Controls

Each one of those has a sub-control , and they will come in and audit to see if you pass that. 


Ron would like us to be familiar with Common Controls and what they are, and if you are interested in working in Risk Management, that will be your life!


Laura's team was one of the best Risk Management companies. They will come in and talk to us about Risk and Security. They will give us scenarios of types of attacks, and we can ask them questions about them. This is the litmus test for NIST.  The NIST frameworks has been expanded. 


The concept of Risk has become formalized, as there are forms , papers ,etc. . We can imagine that there are a lot of sub-knowledge to be had to review these policies. 


Let us go back to our practices that we are looking at for our Risk Formula that will drive our budgeting...


Unlike the Risk Formula to focus our attention, 

They would want us to do a Security Review. The formula we learned the other day is to figure out with item has the highest Risk Score. Even of 1% change of something that has catastrophic consequences, you should treat it highly-likely for our planning purposes. 


Ron uses this concept for Ocean swims. Chances of being attacked by Sharks is slim. 


The formula from the other day should be practiced and adapted for various scenarios as a practice. 


>[!quiz]
>
>Chapters 1 and 4!


How much money we can budget for our Security Plan Formula : 


We need a couple of numbers. If we go for Security+ certificate , this is a potential question : 

These are *qualitative methods*, which is a best guess!

#### Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)


>[!info]
>
>On average, what is the liklihood of something happening EVERY year? 
>
 If something happens once every two years, the ARO is 1/2. You can come up with the number in any way that you like , unless you can explain it!


Once every two years = 1/2 or 0.5


If it happens once a year, ARO = 1

If it happens every four years = 0.25



We have ARO, the next thing is the Asset Value, and you can not spend more than the value of the asset to protect the asset. The customers/company you are protecting do not know the Asset Value, or the value of the equipment, or the cost of losing the equipment if you have to have it!


Example : 


Ron has been living in his house for 35 years. Before that , he lived on another property that was sold via a private sale. Before that, he lived in a very sketchy apartment building. When he was in that apartment, they sorted out their things in boxes, and brought the boxes to his new home. He does not care if he loses them , as he does not know what is in them. Inherently, it does not really cost him anything to lose these boxes. Similarly, organizations may have a similar situation. 

Let us separate the asset from the things you do not care about. If you have 10tbs , and you really care about 2tb of them, you only have to identify and focus on protecting the most important assets. The only way is to work with the Management Department or the Sales Department. 


What is most important to protect? everything! How about each item in the group of items, would you lament their loss? 


This is reducing the attack surface, making your job easier! If you lose this thing, does it cost alot to replace it? would it destroy your reputation if you lose it? 



>[!example] 
>
>Ashley Madison
>
>The attack could have likely destroyed the whole business. 


Understand that it can go from "I dont care about these rocks" to "This would be catastrophic to lose"!


Any information on any hack is well worth examining, because every incident is an experience. 


Most likely foothold is the Spear-Phishing or Phishing! Call/Ask them for the password!

#### Exposure Factor 


To Ron, it is 100%. Especially when dealing with Physical Security. It is difficult to go from 0-100. The **Exposure Factor** is the portion of the asset that you will lose based on this incident .


Loss of Revenue ( in two days ) = 10 million dollars 

We will lose 1 million dollars in revenue

Physical security , if we have a flood, we will lose everything in the basement, 25% of the floor spacing. 

Our Exposure factor is the percentage of the asset you lose in the event of an attack 


If it was 0.5 , you lose 50% of the value (from 0-1)

It is defining the terms in the formula that we need to do the calculation. 0-1

Remember : clients wont use these terms 


The only purpose of this formula is to guard against the thing that happened to me! 


We will be in presentations to the Management Team to fight for costs of security. If someone in the management team says " You are making these numbers up!". We can respond "I have taken a professional approach. I can show you the methodology that I have used", and then present them with the formula


Everyone can argue over the individual pieces, but they have to understand how you reached the conclusion. 


We are almost at the point of understanding ...


#### Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)


Every time this event happens, what does it cost us ? what is the damage ? 

Single Loss Expectancy = Asset Value (10000) X Exposure Factor ( 0.5 ) = 5000 dollars 

The example on the slides : if the asset is 10000 and the Exposure factor is 0.2 , then ...




We have all the basic components that we have, ALE , AV , EF (Exposure Factor - percentage of the asset) , SLE (Single Loss of Expectancy) ...


What we need to know is ...

#### Annualized Loss Expectancy 


This is largley a probability, which makes it a bit harder to think about.


If I am budgeting for this event to happen, and it will NOT happen this year, there is a probability of it happening over the next three years, how much should I budget for this year to prepare for it eventually in ___ years. Because it will not happen this year, we do not have to budget the whole amount to protect ourselves. We would portion some for this year, some for the next year, and the final portion on the third year. 

The Annualized Loss Expectancy = Single Loss Expectancy (how much we will lose when that happens) X Annualized rate of Occurrence   

It works like this : 

If you buy a pickup truck for your business, and it costs 50000 dollars, that year on your taxes you can not claim an expense of 50000 dollars, since you will not use the truck in its value THIS year. This is amertizing an asset value over a number of years . 

If you want a new firewall , and it costs 50000 dollars. How long do you think it will be usable ? 5 years. There are federal schedules on how to calculate costs of property over the span of years .

Worry about : 

Cost of something bad happening 

Probability of it happening every year 


If the probability of something happening every year = value of the asset ( 100%)


If you need to get a generator to combat power loss, you say to the boss "We are in NS. If we lose power , it will cost 20000 dollars in revenue. I need 3000 dollars. What is the annualized loss expectancy ? 100% since we will lose power this year sometime". 


Annualized rate of occurence of a ransomware attack is 2 years for example. 




Example 1 : 

Our on-line e-commerce site produces on average $1,000,000/year. We have a  
robust fault tolerant system but a single DDOS attack will negatively impact this  
by 10%.  
On average we experience a DDOS attack every two years.  
What is the maximum that we can request be added to our security budget each  
year to deal with DDOS attacks?

Givens : 

once every two years , ransomware attack happen! 

ALE = Single Loss Expectancy X Annualized rate of occurrence

 100000 x 0.5 = 50000 dollars for a budget




Example 2  
Kids keep breaking windows in our building.  
Each window costs $500 to replace.  
No part of the broken window can be saved.  
On average, they break three windows a year.  
On average, once every year the broken window leads to $1,000 in water  
damage.  
What is the maximum we can request be added to our annual budget to deal with  
broken windows and the water damage?


Asset Value = 500 per window
Exposure Factor = 100% ( they will break three windows a year)
Annualized Rate of Occurrence = 3
Single Loss Expectancy = Asset Value x Exposure Factor = 500 x 3
Annualized Loss Expectency : SLE X ARO = 500 X 3 = 1500
1/year, it costs 1000 dollars extra. What is the maximum we can budget to 

Therefore we should budget 2500 per year. 




We can accept , mitigate , transfer risks, these are terms indicating an action. What should be done in the broken windows situation? 

##### Acceptance Policy 

"I accept it is a reality"

##### Transfer Risk 

We can buy a broken-window insurance, where they would cover the replacement costs.
If the insurance company decided to add an extra amount to cover this eventuality, it is possible that we would not have 2500 of spending to do!


##### Risk Avoidance 
We can brick the windows, so there would not be a risk anymore


###### Risk Reduction/Mitigation
We can install wiremesh of the windows to cut down on their attempts to break the windows 


##### Risk Elimination
Arrest those kids! 





Ron had a friend who developed an insurance calculation applications.  in South Carolina , houses are built on sandbars. The houses were wiped out for the third time. The insurance company decided that they will no longer provide insurance coverage on rebuilt houses. 



It is important to know how to use these terms in our lives, as this would cement the knowledge into our lives. 




If we have a high consequence asset, or something very important, and if that thing is damaged/removed in anyway, the consequences are terrible. You have to eliminate qualitative planning as much as possible. You may have to justify spending to an inquiry. We want to substitute as much as possible a Defendable Quantitative Analysis of spending. This is exceptionally important if human lives are in question due to underspending. 


If we do not have that type of data to base our decisions on it, we will have to qualatative analysis if the consequences are *minimal*. You will not ask a grocery shop employee about a DDoS attack, but our experience and knowledge should prepare us to do so. 



Current Assignment : 

Nessus Scan 
When you produce the report, you have to give the report to management. You will take technical output , and describe it in a non-technical way as much as possible. You can chose different words, and avoid gargon. It has to be readable! Ron suggests by starting by getting Nessus Essentials, play with it at our machine, scan 127.0.0.1 , and just learn Nessus. In our own time, this is the best thing we can do! It takes an hour to scan two machines. We have to set up accounts etc. and he will guide us on Nessus!
