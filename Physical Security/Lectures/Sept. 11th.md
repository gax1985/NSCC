The big question when it comes to security is , where do I start? I have been hired by a company, and first duty is to write a report on Physical Security and how it could be improved ?

The next step, is testing vulnerabilities. 


One of the easiest things to do is a **CEPTED Audit**. You are doing it for yourself. If you have a scheduled appointment for a client, well before you meet the client, do a **CEPTED Audit** on your own. Approach the building on day/night, walk around the building. Check the email : do not go into the business, or talk to the employees. Physical Penetration Testing comes later...


You are doing the audit for yourself. it is a way to know the weaknesses/strengths. It prepares you for the first meeting/discussion. 


If they are doing things right, you can open the discussion with praise for the things they are doing right. People hate us as security individuals. We come in and we say everything they are doing wrong. They see us as the enemy, someone who knows everything. ...



There is a saying 

"If you are criticizing someone/constructive feedback, do a sandwich technique : what they are doing good | doing bad | doing good "


If we mention the bad things right away, it spoils the conversation. 


We have a good lay of the land. We are sitting at the desk thinking about the first step : 


Network 
Building ? 


Figure out what you are protecting! 


If you ask the client about what they need protecting, in your own mind , get thinking about what you are responsible for protecting. 


Physical security overlaps cyber security  : We are protecting the information inside the building. If we are doing physical security, we do not care about switches or routers: we are protecting the information stored on their systems, or their ability to facilitate the operations for their system. 


Sometimes it is not just the information. Sometimes it is the technical equipment. 


So, once we have identified the **asset**, ( most people do not know what they have, or whats worth protecting)...


If we are to take away the asset, what you would you pay me to get it back ? 
If they respond , "millions. it is critical to daily functioning", or , "we do not care!"

It is important because if it is the latter , you do not have to think about protecting ...


Whatever it is, this eludes to something else. 


We might have a regulatory requirement for the client we are working with/company working for, where seven years of tax information is protected. 


For small companies, they may care about protecting the inventory. If they suddenly have a dream about losing their inventory, or someone stealing all their stocks, Ron was in Dartmouth Crossing at Marks, and around the door, he saw someone grab a alot of jackets and ran out of the store. Customers offered to chase the thief. 


We might be responsible for protecting against smash and grab, or hospital emergency room where we are protecting narcotics. 


#### What is it we are trying to protect ?


If someone steals hospital clothes, they wont spend too much money protecting the clothes. 


"What if you use all the tax records? "

"What if you lose all the sales history?"

"What if you lose 20% of your inventory?" --> costs 200000 to replace. How often does it arrive into the warehouse? 6 months-1year. That means that you can not sell anything for 6 months-1 year, and a tremendous loss of revenue. 

If we are protecting machinery, Ron used to sell highspeed metal milling machines which were expensive, if someone was to damage/steal one of the machines (emphasis on *damage* as well as *loss*).  Imagine the costs of replacing the item or fixing it. 


You have to keep in mind the cost of vandalism : maintainance, repair, and hiring someone else to fix it if necessary. 

Put everything together , and you end up with the cost of the asset (formula from last year : Asset Value)


*You never spend more to protect something than what it is worth* ...


When we start making requests for something that could happen, someone who knows what they are doing, and you end up losing credibility, due to the costs of protection being higher than the value : 

*Know what you have to protect!*


This will be in the assignment : 

Take the facility,. comment/describe the security posture, and describe in great detail what you will do to reach MEDIUM LEVEL of Security 

We have to IMPEDE < DETECT > ASSESS

Is there a camera , does it have a field of view that covers the area? do you need overlapping cameras to cover the entire area? Is there motion detector? are there dogs walking around ? Can they detect whether it is a Racoon or a Dog? 

Levels of security : 


Minimum : Impedes unauthorized external activity (barriers, door and window with locks)
Low-Leve: impedes and detects unauthorized external activity ( add better locks, lighting and alarms) - unmonitored
Medium : Impedes , detects and assess unauthorized external activity ( intrusion detection systems that signal staff, establish a broader perimeter with fences or dogs, unarmed security personnel with basic training) 
High , Impedes, detects and assesses both internal and external  unathorized activity ( state of the art equipment , CCTV, security lighting , trained trusted armed guards, increased access control such as biometrics incident response plans, coordination with external resources, regular security assessment )


Fill in the rest from the slides ....




List of basic requirements :


If you can slow down the attacker, it increases the detection time and stoppage time ( three doors, three locks, two fences )


You have not talked to the client. You know what they are trying to protect. You go shopping at Amazon, Google, "I need integrated alarm/light system".  You can find something very expensive that combines both, or buy components that work together to achieve the objectives you need to meet 


#### Design Reference Threat 


The key factor in determining the physical security plan is the key factor for determining any security plan 


Design Reference Threat : List everything that could possibly go wrong (refer to the textbook about the emergency room, and there are details about nuclear facilities).


who are the bad guys and what are they capable of? 

If we are walking in the back alley in New Orleans, you are dealing with a group of people who want to rob you, armed with a knife or a Taser. 


If you have a gun, or have other individuals with you , unless you are capable of dealing with all these things , do not do that activity! 


If you are protecting a warehouse in Burnside that sells pieces of Diesel engines, the Russian mafia wont show up to steal engine parts. You are dealing with burglars, who range from a methhead to an organized crime ring. 

In Halifax, organized professionals will do the same action as we will be doing for the assignment. You should have a plan to deal with both situations. 

You need some kind of surveillance system that will detect this sort of activity. You would need a dog that barks, or a camera system in place, and have someone fast-forward the cameras next day. Camera systems split the feed of multiple cameras on the same screen. There could be other types of sensors such as motion detection lights. Professionals will not care. The methhead might get spooked. 


For each threat , characterize the threat, the liklihood of the threat , the threat actor, threat actor's liklihood of encounter. 


We do not start from zero, but start from natural threats : fires , hurricanes, power outages.

You may have to correct some things ...
Once we have the natural threats accomodated, figure out who the threat actors are, what they are capable of, assume a group of skilled engineers in St Petersburg will hack your organization. 

Insiders are a possibility ...

Ron worked at a place where all the bathroom equipment like toilet paper were empty constantly. A lot of employees steal from businesses.


You can figure it out easily by walking into the place and looking around. 

If we have to badge in somewhere ,you can assume it is a higher threat. what is the nature of the goods/information? 


We have an idea about the hackers, natural disasters, know what they want to achieve, what they are likely to use., and we have to match the threat with keeping the costs relative to the value of the assets we are protecting.

#### Physical Barriers


First concept of layered security :


Security begins with the outside walls of the building : separate with some degree of space the outside of the building vs the distance from the outside of the building to the road , to the next property, if we are against a sidewalk/street , the building is rejected. 

Concept : Outter layer of protection goes even further. It is dealt with in risk assessment


Intelligence is a layer of protection. if the business falls into a category where it was attacked by a group of hackers, and you subscribe/monitor a threat intelligence feed that monitors activity that shows them getting interested in similar businesses to yours, or they discuss your business in the dark web, or some information from your business was released on the dark web : 



Know the threat before it comes to your door!


Threat Intelligence Feeds cost money, but it could come with the equipment/intelligence that you buy. Good Sources, CSIS, CISCO, US Command of Cybersecurity . Questionable sources are the ads you see on Facebook, where they type your name on the dark web. 


Ron's friend used to be involved with threat intelligence with CISCO , and created his/her own company that does the same thing. 


There are many small companies that do this online, but Ron thinks that you should get the best source of information that you can afford within the designated budget. YOU should be the best threat intelligence source that you can be!



Layered Defense :


Fences : They come in all shapes and sizes. The highest fence you can have in NS is 5 feet (residential). There is a rule about fences: Fences in themselves are not great barriers. if you build a wooden fence 5 feet high , someone could cut it with a tool. Ron climbed under fences. A fence with barbed wire is a good beginning due to the psychological effect it has. Electric fences are better. Ron's favorite : 2 fences with some distance between them, with barbed wire on top of both fences, with motion detection, heat detection, place something between the fences. It gives you a delay effect against the intruder. You need to have a clear view of the other side of the fence. You need the fence far enough in the property that does not have anything leaning against the fence on the other side of it. Having two of everything is ALWAYS a great idea! 
"when it comes to backups , 1=none , 2=1". Have two fences, two walls , two thorny hedges. Once you have scaled the fence or crossed the neutral area, climbed the second fence, and you are inside the property :


You have : 

two dogs (intimidating. Psychologically they are effective!)
two cameras 
two motion detectors


Recognize the fact that *we are passing through zones*. As the thief gets closer to the treasure/vault/data center, possibly in the basement, this is the highest security zone/center of the castle. As you get closer to the center, you pass increasing security zones, which means "you are not allowed there". You increase the ability to monitor who is there. In the treasure center, you do not place windows in the room. 


Ron encountered a business that had a double-glass security zone, that had windows looking immediately outside of it. 


You need to have monitoring/logging/protection/assessing capabilities at each security zone : guard with a clipboard.




#### Security in Depth


One thing that is often forgotten : Employees!


The main thing to understand about detection and alarm systems is that they have to be integrated! ( Ron will be looking for that in our assignments)

They should have cellphones/2-way radios. We should always have the ability to communicate with the right people at the right time. Let us assume you have an Oil Refinery. Like any business, fire is a hazard. Fire in a refinery is much more serious than fire in a greenhouse. When it comes to communication, you have to take into account  the time it takes to communicate with authorities (fire department). Do you recall  the phones at the gates of a mall that is a direct line to police/taxi? 


Communication capability does not work if you do not know who to call or their number. 


Communication methods should have supporting documentation. Have you had to call the fire department for an immediate emergency ? if you get training from law enforcement, when you call them , they will ask for your address ( you may not remember). Next to the phone, you will find all the information you will need ( in case you are too shaken up to remember)

Ron had his apartment broken into, and the thief walked out, and the police was outside. Ron was trying to describe where he was to 911. He had difficulties remembering the RCMP detachment. Having the phone numbers of who you have to call should be next to the phone in case of this eventuality. 

Most businesses are operating business phones you put a placard next to each phone that includes the phone number for emergencies, name/phone number for security response teams. 

You finally have a *Security Plan*. The textbook does an excellent job because it has models for documentation. You can refer to it whenever you need to, and you end up building a professional-looking plan .


Standard Security Plan : 
=============================

Description of facility
Security Organization
Discussion/Description of : 
	physical barriers
	alarm systems
	access controls
	lighting
	communications systems
	surveillance systems

A description of security team (Org, training, equipment resources, procedures, etc.)

Third-Party Resources ( agreements with police forces or policing agencies)
Plan for annual assessment and upgrading 



Everyone who is involved has to know their role ,, be cross trained, understand their equipment, and understand their procedures. 

Ron is a huge fan of "In case of …" , ransomware , fire, thefts , etc.


You do not want to make up things on the fly. People are afraid to make decisions. Ron was dealing with a hack at a water treatment facility. He had the IT individual with the leadership team. Ron mentioned that the sewage was getting pumped back in into their systems. The IT individual did not have the authority to turn off the pumps. Ron asked him about who does have the authority, and it took them a very long time to answer that question. It is much worse that this happened at 2 AM in the middle of the night. It would have helped to have the "In case of ..." binder





Ron is a huge fan of inviting fire marshals , police, or emergency workers inside secure facilities. This way, they would know in case of emergency where everything is. The key is to establish the relationship between them before emergencies. 


If you take time to develop a personal relationship with your suppliers, your life will be much easier. 
In case of emergencies, it would be far better to know who exactly to talk to 



Hypothetically, in 6-8 months, you have the plan ready, but when you are presenting, you end up making a blunder because you forget a golden rule : 


You never tell a person to do something to prevent something bad .


You lead with : here are the threats you are facing , here are the results of this disaster, so you should do this … 

1. Define the problem
2. what if the problem continues
3. alternatives
4. eliminate each alternative until only your plan remains …
5. Detail of your plan 
6. Tailor your presentation, and the features of your solution, to the audience. specifically to those members of the audience that must approve your plan. 

On your first time around, you will make mistakes. Talk to yourself and discuss the plan with yourself. Leave it for a while and come back to it , so you see it with different eyes


Finish it a week in advance, put it aside, and look at it again. 

Let someone else play the devil's advocate. 

At the debate , they knew what the possible responses will be, and they were prepared to answer every eventuality. 

Get into the point where everyone in the room agrees that your idea is the best one. They will feel that they have made the decision themselves, and psychologically, they will think they reached the logical conclusion , which is our plan. 

Give them alternatives to our plan that we know that wont work. And tell them why they would not work. Keep eliminating the alternatives until the only plan you have is YOUR plan. 

Give them all the information they think they need 


Tailor the presentation to the audience. One of the things American presidents get in the morning is the daily intelligence reports : all the threats accounted for by the intelligence division in the past 24 hours. Once you are in the meeting, all the supporting documents/materials are presented. 


If we have a management team willing to listen, the presentation has to be within the span of 10 minutes and delivered effectively. Provide them with supporting materials ahead of time. 


At the end of the mission, we will get everything we want, and if we do not , after doing a great job, it means that there is a built-in vulnerability. We have to win. if we do not win, work on the resume, something bad will happen, and we get the blame, and we get fired.
