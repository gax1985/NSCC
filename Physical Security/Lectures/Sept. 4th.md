It is based on the idea that you can create subconscious psychological and emotional responses of people simply by the environment where they exist



When you walk into a temple or a cathedral or a mosque, there is an unusual feeling to the building. You feel a pressure that you need to be quiet. That is based on experimental design that has been in place for thousands of years. It is based on Sacred Geometry, height of the wall  height of the ceiling and the width in the room. 

The same is true , which we will see during the walk, we will notice subconscious things that guide our behavior. It is designed to decrease the occurrence of crime!




When we are operating in a career in cybersecurity, you are often asked to consult on Physical Security. You will be able to get to the point where you can spot a bad lock.  A graduate student broke into the data centre in 2 minutes. We will not be locksmiths. We wont be installing locks. Our jobs is to judge a Lock's security. We will get to the point that unnoticed things in terms of physical security will become noticeable. 



Someone brought a company to do a vulnerability test, including Physical Security, in the meeting with the executive, he offered to do a walk with the leadership team. This person was able to covertly join a walkthrough of the building when the leadership team did the walk. 



We will do a nighttime monitoring shift of a building!


When doing a vulnerability test, you should do a physical security assessment ahead of the first meeting, as you would know if there is any differences from the actual reality of the building. We will be able to immediately assess the physical security of the building. We will be able to spot vulnerability, write a report, but we wont be implementing the fixes. We can add tips on the locations of windows, placements of cameras, etc... 




We will see the first approach of a physical security assessment!


## CEPTED


It is covered extensively in the first chapter of the text. It will feed into our first assignment, which is important to get started right away. The first objective is to choose the target. People who do poorly take a very long time to identify a suitable target. He will provide us with categories that will help us with choosing a target. The course will follow the textbook regularly, and we will have quizes that are designed to make you read the chapter. 




### Chapter 1 


Examine the approaches of the hedges. The hedges is trimmed down, which provides a view of the building. a Tall hedge prevents the wide front view. 



Design alters behaviour, even though you do not know why. 


A Cashier's station is usually against a wall. The space is designed that prevents the person of going behind the counter. 


The design MUST recognize the use of the space. 


We can telll that our room is a classroom. It is obvious! This is not necessarily the case for businesses inside and outside the building. We do NOT want someone to walk into the restricted part of the building under the pretense of looking for the washroom. It is often asked to individuals in the building if they encountered others looking for a washroom in that part of the building. The wrong idea is "DONT ENTER". It is preferable that they feel they should not walk into that area. 


One of the concepts behind CEPTED is that emotional control often works better!


We have to recognize specific threats to that area. 

A hospital emergency room : 

Threats facing an Emergency Room : 


1. Runaway patients
2. People stealing narcotics.


In Cybersecurity, what threat actors we are facing ? 

Ron mentioned that the green scrubs is that you stole it from the emergency room. A less serious threat , but if we see that happening, and we see everyone wearing hospital green scrubs, that should be considered a threat. 


You often have violent criminals in an emergency room. The situation is continuing, as someone could still try to harm the other, or both enemies are placed in the same environment. For this, you should have multiple entrances.



Mitigate actions must suit the intended use of the space : 

Do not make the security measure something that causes problems and issues for utilizing the space!

It appears that someone in IT stole the remotes in all of the classrooms , under the cause of preventing individuals from altering the configurations of the projectors. They mentioned that if the inputs need to be changed, someone from IT must come and adjust it! Most people felt the same way on Multiple Factor Authentication!


There are security mitigations that we can use that do not impact the usage of the area : 

Anything that triggers anger of frustration is often the wrong move. 
The best approach is to have something that does not impede the usage, and does not affect the behavior of the room. 



Space : 



1. Public : use the the resident and the public (Parking Lot)
2. Semi-Public : Used by the public without passing through security ( Lobby, waiting room, reception area)
3. Semi-Private : Use by residents and guests )with restrictions. Usually behind some form of access control (offices , meeting rooms) 
4. Private: Use by residents , invitied (accompanied ) guests and service individuals only. Strict Access Control (Labs, Apartment). 



**Transition boundaries between spaces should be clearly implied!**




## Hardening Targets 



We are denying access! It is not meant to deny access to people who use the asset, but you want to make sure everyone is authorized to be there.



#### Natural Elements :


A lawn  ( Has much less impact on use )

Window is Natural Surveillance. Natural elements have less impact on use. If you figure out ways to alter behaviour with natural elements, it is usually best and least intrusive. 

Lighting is only useful when some form of visual surveillance is used/present 

#### Artificial Element : 

Walkway ( we know that we need to walk on the walkway, without a sign saying 'Do not walk on the grass")... plant the grass, wait for it to go yellow/brown on some areas, and build the walkway there!

Cameras are Artificial Surveillance ( a camera not having a light, or a camera not having anyone monitor it are useless). If we have a camera watching a backdoor of the building, and there is no light, and there is graffiti all over the walls, that means it is most likely that noone is watching that camera.




### Spatial Mangement 


1. Natural Access Control : Floor in the executive areao f the office parts. No chairs are there. It is a natural access control
2. Natural Surveillance : Windows and People. Let us say that we have an outside area of the building that does not have surveillance on a regular basis, and it creates a vulnerability for you (unsafe area, as people can move there unseen). You can place a sitting bench and a smoking area, it will increase traffic there. You can have safe activities in unsafe areas provides natural surveillance
3. Territorial Reinforcement : A hedge in front of the property for example. You go to natural reinforcement.



## Access Control 


1. Locks , lighting, alarms ( mechanical )
2.  guards (organized) , 
3. spatial definition (natural). 
 
#### They create the perception of risk. It is better to have a dog, or use means of access control to force the attacker towards a different vulnerability. 

Criminals like you are always accessing for risk

Criminals want to do the crime, and they want to do this crime in the easiest way possible.  

### Surveillance


Keeps intruders under observation. Much like Access Control, it also increases the perception of risk. Ron did not believe the science behind a notice/sticker that the house is monitored by a Security Company. 

Mechanical (Lights, Cameras) , Organized (guards) , Natural (Windows.)

When incorporating natural elements, it leads to territoriality.


### Territorial Definition 


Creates a sense of a community made up of those who belong and those who did not. Some neighborhoods/housing projects have a central courtyard by design, so the number of surveillance/increased risk for intruders go up!


If we do this properly for an organization/business, every single employee becomes a security person. You create a sense of belonging, and everyone would know who belongs there and who does not. It is important for everyone to know each other. the whole purpose is to be able to spot individuals who do not belong. 


You create a sense of community in your business or association. When you are on an assessment where you are able to walk freely without being stopped, this is an immediate risk. The idea is not to force them to recognize everyone, but to make them care. You create a sense of community, so they can spot the change. Know the network so you can spot the anomalies. 


keeps intruders under observation. 
Access Control and Surveillance have traditionally overlooked environmental measures. Ideally, you want them to make the decision themselves not to be there




## Maintenance 


It can create a sense of tolerance of disorder or a lack of attention. It gives the idea that noone cares . Examples : 


1. Broken Locks
2. Rusted Fences
3. Burnt Out Lights
4. Overgrown Shrubbery


If people see things and they know it to be wrong, and they do not do anything about it, the surveillance is useless. Physical Penetration Testing works because people have a subconcious idea that something is not right, they would tend to do something. If we have a janitor sweeping the floor should feel comfortable about reporting an intruder.




Aerial View of the Campus :


We will need a Google Earth view of the building. It allows us to annotate, sketch notes, and add ideas for enhancements.  If the facility did not have a fence, we can have an identical picture with a red line indicating a perimeter fence. 


A Stellar Assignment Example : 


The aerial view of NSCC's campus.  ( indicating the crime areas)
He does not expect a video of the report. If we are part of a surveillance team, having a video that takes you through the property is a good idea to have. 


We should make it as real as possible. He wants us to experience the vision/mentality of someone who is doing surveillance. Think on your fears, and the things that make you uncomfortable, and think about the things that may give a smile on a perpetrator's face (We should obviously prevent that). 


What is the thing about the environment that makes you feel UNCOMFORTABLE? 


Targets :

Industrial Parts , businesses


The example he will give us is about a Bank. The more personal the space, the less likely he is to approve it.

Part of the recommendation is building a perimeter fence ( so businesses that can not have that would not have a multi-tiered defense.) A business that functions from 9-5 and stays closed. 


We can not proceed until he approves our target! 


No multi-business facilities. It is one business per building. It is a standalone business.  No Joint occupancy.
