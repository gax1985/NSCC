He has put an *Example Security Assessment* as well as some other items


We will finish the unfinished parts from last class


There is a talk by Physical Security Specialists, and they discuss accessories that will help!



Assignments have page numbers from the textbooks, so we should check with him

# Chapter 1 


## 3D Approach


3 dimensions of human space


All human space has a designated purpose.


This is getting us to recognize space, what it is utilized for, and in a way like identifying individuals. This way, we can tell if there is a mismatch.


All human space have a designated purpose, and that purpose should be the only purpose


Human spaces have a social, cultural, legal , physical definitions that define acceptable behaviour.


The design of the space should support the intended behavior ( such as putting a couch in a classroom)


#### Feng Shui 

It is a practical application of space designation. All the spaces have a use, and something specific that needs to be there. If you have something that does not fit, you get rid of it. 




---

When looking at a space, we are working at a design level of that space. We are making observations on the space, and we make a guide on how to design it. 


#### How is the space defined ?

Ron has an excavator dig a Fire Pit in his backyard. The radius of the fire pit is the distance that you need to have materials away from the fire for a safety-based consideration. In Scotland/Ireland, there is a big open field, and a stone circle. The inner part of the Stone Circle becomes its own *space*. When you put borders around something, you change its designation, and you associate a definition of usage for that space

What is the space used for? 
Where are the borders of the space?

	have a low hedge, cement vs walkway. Make people feel like they should be doing something without you having to do it

Are there cultural/social definitions of the space? 

	How do you dress one place vs how you dress for another? You do not play video games in class. 

	What are people expected to do there? 


	You do not need to have a sign that tells you what to do in a space, or what is acceptable. You only need signs in places that it is not obvious. We know that we can not smoke on a plane anymore. The signs are still present for legal purposes, but we all know. 


When Ron moved to his house 30 years ago, there were a lot of Pine trees on his side of the lawn. He looked outside one day, and found a neighbor mowing his lawn. The neighbor mentioned that she is not sure this is his lawn. She was angry, but he showed her the surveyor's definition of the property. It is possible that the hedge was not clearly defined .


Example :

A Server Room was used to store boxes. If Ron was there, the boxes would easily jump out, as it would be not in fitting with the space's usage



Where does the yard begin, and when does it end ? 


Are there conflicts between the purpose or the definition? 


	In the Atrium, there is a bit of a conflict in that area, as it is confusing for many



Does the Design Support the Function ?

	Is it suitable for what you are trying to do ? 

	A power circuit is not appropriate for the use of the classroom. There should be adequate power for the utilization of the room. You can decide to designate an area as a Server room, but you need to add things like HVAC to support the usage



Is there anything in the space that makes it unsuitable for the use? 


	In Dalhousie, there is an L-shaped classroom. It caused Ron difficulties with attenting a class there


Is there confusion in the design, and how it is intended to control behavior ? 


	it is a situation that you would say "I did not know that I could not do so here". This sometimes end up causing signs to be placed there. He had put a sign in the Team Meeting Rooms, where individuals would take it over as their own area (Phone call area)



Clear border defintions : Subconcious tools / Natural surveilance is a huge opportunity for us to take security in consideration. It is better to place natural surveilance there instead of a camera for example 




Place Safe Activities in Unsafe Locations to increase natural surveilance :

	if we have a side of our building that is not monitored, place something like a smoking area/bench there. 

Place unsafe activities in areas that have natural surveilance. 

	Natural Surveilance : Where people can see it 
	Unnatural surveilance : Where cameras are placed


Place a Natural Element ( hedge ) to define territory. The barriers would cause conflicts, and crazy neighbors. 

Do not impede the ability to monitor the area. Something simple as a sidewalk is a boundary definition . 


Re-Schedule the usage of the space to allow effective use :

	If outside of the building is not monitored, you would find someway you can use that effectively through natural surveilance

Overcome distances between spaces with better communications : 

	If we have multiple-building-complexes, if we want to talk from one building to another, we would have to avoid one person being a messenger between the two individuals. You would for example have multiple ways of communications. 

>[!example]
>Regular Radio vs Packet Radio : Regular radio is easily intercepted. Packet Radios are digital >packets that are encrypted by the sender, and decrypted by the receiver. 



Ron had a client performing a security function on a boat,, if you are on a shore/another boat nearby, you can hear everything. 


IMPORTANT :

Ron is trying to walk through the concepts discussed in Chapter 1 and Chapter 4 ( 4 we have to reference for the assignment). It is a good opportunity for asumptions and questions. 

These are overlooked during a physical assessment : 


The assignment involves changing the building, from a bank to another utilization. 

People do a bank but still has a drive-through teller ( you do not have to talk about the drivethrough). If the change will be happening, we could do it from the ground up. You are commoneting and describing the current security situation , and recommending changes. 

Crime analysis : Geographic and similarity of offences : we have to know what the space is that you exist in in a crime-analysis perspective. The Pubs area on the other side of Bayers Road was huge in terms of drugs, and everyone is armed. You have to be fully aware of the crime analysis of the area


Demographic : Looks like an old school, retired families, but we can actually get demographic information ( like income levels from Statistics Canada) 


Barriers to Entry , Barriers to Exit. 

We are doing mild observational actions. If we are doing this for a client, we would sit there in alternating times and alternating situations observing everything. You would watch employees and that they do, if they hold the door open, where they go to smoke, if they leave the door open. If you can blend in with what people are doing, it would make things easier. 


We cannot do this for the assignment : Use interviews! Ask them if they have challenges, how it can be enhanced, what did you notice? People are People! Everyone in the organization are contributing memebrs to the success story of the organization. 

Everything about this is creating that neighborhood watch community spirit. Needing to understand/know what is happening there so offenders can be spotted easily. If we have a housing project with a surrounding courtyard, what stops criminals from walking in ? 



Remember : Everything Ron is telling us applies to the digital world as well. If you know your digital space, you would easily spot it

CEPTED Strategies are scalable to  Rooms , areas etc



Prevention : 

It requires understanding of criminal behaviour, and what criminals see when they enter a space. Identify what makes YOU nervous, because it will make someone else nervous. Remove the EASINESS and INCREASE the fear. You just have to FEEL It. it involves the sense of community, which takes a lot of time to develop ( you would add access control, camera monitoring). You can transition when you have a community watch situation or feeling 


ALL HANDS on DECK approach : 


Ron can tell us from experience that this works well : 

	if you train your employees well, (clicking on emails), new employees would ask "have you seen this email?" and experienced workers would inform them not to. Every experienced worker would become an unofficial security officer. The drop can be significant in terms of occurences of unwanted behaviour. 


The people who are tasked with doing that do not talk to each other usually, or may have animosity (Physical Security guys vs Cyber Security guys). One is not above the other, and both are there as a team, each bringing in their own security skills. 


Example : Hack of the Democratic National Convention, John Pedistas specifically. 1800 employees had a Spear Phishing email. The email said "They were supposibly from gmail. 'someone has hacked your GMAIL, we stopped them, but we need you to reset your password!'. John Padista seen it, he was not sure if it was real, called his IT security guys to ask them, and they answered that it is real ( The IT security guy while being investigaed mentioned that it was a typo , as he meant to say 'it is not real' ).


Ron's old boss : if you are not sure if you should do something, you should not do it!


Ron gets the same emails occasionally.



REMOVING Silos through increased coordination and involvement ( such as involving liason officers from the police or RCMP. This becomes much more important later on. It is important to have that relationship on a name-to-name basis). 



Security team : They need to have appropriate training. Knowing the people in the class, if you were hired to establish a security team, think about who in the class you would hire for network security? who would you hire for endpoint security? who would you hhire for Physical Security? You would start with people who have a natural affinity for the intended position. Everyone has to be everyone's number 2 . You have to be cross-trained in a team for multiple positions. 


Ron will do incident response for an organization. One of the great things to do is to have an incident response exercise in a particular room. You tell the IT individual not to show up. You would say "Server has been hacked/. What would you do? The IT individual is not available". You would gauge what they would all do in that situation. This is why it is important to be cross-trained. Ron hired an individual who wrote everything on paper and locked it up in a safe . Everything that was critical for the organization was placed on paper in that safe. It is not bad to have secondary storage for important information. 


Everyone needs needed equipment : Ron took over Network administration for an organization, and he mentioned to the employees to forget everything that they had known for procedures. He asked them to write on paper the procedures that they would need to do in case of an emergency. for us, it might include having a Go-Bag that includes Red Team Tools or Blue Team Tools, and including cellphones + Packet Radios. 


Ron was doing a communications plan for a political party. He had all the operatives in a room, and he asked them if they knew each other's phone numbers. They exchanged numbers. He asked them if they knew each other's addresses , they said no, and he asked them to visit each person's house. It is important to have these resources. 



Integrated Command and Control : Include everyone that has to be included. As part of the War Room , you would have a Fire specialist , Physical Security Etc, and they would have backup methods of communication. Germans did this efficiently in WWII. If you have a tank squadron, they would have an airforce operator in the tank, so if they needed air support, this person would ask their department to support the tank's operation


Policies: Everyone has to understand and know the security policies. Ron had trained police personnel, and other individuals like a bus driver. If you had a job in HRM, Ron had to train them on the policies that they had to do. He provided them the policies in paper form. They would be quizzed on what they needed to do. If you dont , you would have Unintentional Vulnerabilities. If someone does not know how to do something, they will make something up and train others on the wrong actions to take. 


Ron was going to invest in a company, and there was a lead developer. He asked him "Who do you report to?" , and they pointed at the wrong individual in the room, and the wrong individual pointed at the wrong individual in the room. Their designated persons respectively was not clearly identified. 


Patton "Fix fortifications for the stupidity of man". There is ALWAYS a way around something!


Never feel that you have everything or every contingency covered!



All components have to work together! Cameras + Lighting , Networks + logging , Networks + logging + alerts + someone monitoring the alerts. 


The cost of any security system should NEVER cost more than the value of the protected object! This is a good guide for budgeting. The trick is to know the real value of the asset.





Important : Figure out what you are trying to protect! Some would say "computers, etc". They mean " Networks + Information" are the important assets. What is the value of the information assets? is it reputational damage? if you are a manufacturer, and you lose the IP , or the IP is produced by another company in another country, the damages could be tremendous. 


Physical equipment : damage repair , maintainance. If we ask the client, what is the information we are trying to protect? everything is not a good answer. So we go back to "What is it you are trying to protect?"


## Levels of Security 


You have to raise the faculity to Level Medium


#### Minimum  

Impedes unauthorized access ( barriers , doors , windows with locks)


#### Low-Level


Impedes and detecs unathorized external activities ( add better locks , on a network intrustion prevention software). These are unmonitored



#### Medium 


Impedes, detects and assesses : it is not good enough for us to have an alarm go off if noone will go check it out. We ccould have someone on station that will walk over and check the alarm/look at the camera/seeing a light go off on a panel, or you could contract someone on an outside agency that will send a guard over. This is more common! This includes a company contracted to monitor networks! Most of us do not have the budget to do so. Contracted companies would have a SOC that they notify the organization.

Permieter fences, unarmed security guard with minimum training that will assess the situation

Ron would want to see perimeter fences in our recommendations, electronic sensors, cameras , lighting, and security personnel to monitor all these things ( a low-paid security guard monitoring cameras 24/7)

#### High

Impedes, Detects Assesses Internal AND External Security ( like Lockheed Martin monitoring their employees) . This is probably not your working environment


#### Maximum


Impedes, Detects, Assesses and Neutralize any unathorized external or internal activity ( backup power, redundant alarm systems, trustworthy active security personnel capable of neutralizing threats). It does not have to be used often, due to the intimidation factor. If you see a guard armed with an automatic assault rifle and a dog, it intimidates the offenders. 

Criminals need Desire and Opportunity. High level security reduces the desire ( I do not want to be shot)



## Security Posture


Expand the capability that you could consider 


### Impede 

Create a barrier


### Delay 


Ron's favorite. It gives you time from the point you detect it to your response time. This is like daisy-chaining firewalls : you have one firewall separating the DMZ from the core network, and immediately behind this firewall, there is another firewall from another manufacturer. An attacker might be able to get through the first firewall, and instead of them gaining access to the internal network, they see another locked door. If you are doing an intrusion, you would need to know the time needed to get in and get out. You would not want any unintended blockages towards the goal. 

Two fences, two doors, daisy-chained firewalls , multiple intrusion prevention systems


You can go to Google Earth, and you can study which lock manufacturer they have used for the front gate. If you go there, you would see another locked door with a different lock



### Detect 


The ability to detect everything. If facing a locked door, if someone brings a sledgehammer to bypass the door altogether, then you would detect it


### Deny 


A mote around the castle. 


You need to Detect and you need to Assess

### Assess


### Response


Think of a response to the incident. 



You plan for each requirement for the appropriate component, and make sure it works together in an integrated fashion.
