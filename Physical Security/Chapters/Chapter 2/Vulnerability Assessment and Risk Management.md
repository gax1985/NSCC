The likelihood of an event in any given year.  
i.e. We have a break in every 2 years. There the ARO is  
½ or 0.5.

#### Asset Value  (AV)  
The value of the Asset to be protected. Never limited to  
just the cost of the item.

#### Exposure  Factor (EV)  
The percentage of the Asset value you lose with each  
occurrence. 0 -1  
An Exposure factor of 0.5 means that with each event we  
lose half the value of the asset.

#### Single Loss  Expectancy (SLE)  
The loss ($) incurred for each event.  
SLE = AV x EF  
An Asset has a Value of $10,000 and an Exposure Factor of  
20% or 0.2.  
SLE = 10,000 X 0.2 = 2,000  
With every occurrence of the event we lose $2,000.

#### Annualized  Loss Expectancy  (ALE)  
The loss ($) we should budget for each year.  
ALE = SLE x ARO  
Our SLE is $2,000  
Our ARO is 0.5  
We should budget to cover a loss of $1,000 each year.  
Does this mean that we can ACTUALY expect to lose  
$1,000/year to this event? No.

##### Example 1  
Our on-line e-commerce site produces on average $1,000,000/year. We have a  
robust fault tolerant system but a single DDOS attack will negatively impact this  
by 10%.  
On average we experience a DDOS attack every two years.  
What is the maximum that we can request be added to our security budget each  
year to deal with DDOS attacks?

On average we experience a DDOS attack every two years.  
What is the maximum we should request be added to our security budget each year to deal with  
DDOS attacks?  
AV = 1,000,000  
EF = 0.1  
SLE = 100,000  
ARO = ½ =0.5  
ALE = 100,000 * .5 = $50,000.  
We can request up to $50,000 per year to deal with DDOS attacks.

##### Example 2  
Kids keep breaking windows in our building.  
Each window costs $500 to replace.  
No part of the broken window can be saved.  
On average, they break three windows a year.  
On average, once every year the broken window leads to $1,000 in water  
damage.  
What is the maximum we can request be added to our annual budget to deal with  
broken windows and the water damage?

##### Example 2  
Kids keep breaking windows in our building.  
Each window costs $500 to replace.  
No part of the broken window can be saved.  
On average, a window is broken three times a year.  
On average, once every year window breakage leads to $1,000 in water damage.  
What is the maximum we can request be added to our annual budget to deal with broken windows and the water  
damage?  
Window ALE is $1,500  
Water Damage ALE is $1,000  
We should request an annual budget allocation of $2,500.  
Do we have any other alternatives?

##### Example 2 – Alternatives.  
 1. Status quo (acceptance of Risk).  
 2. We could buy Window and water damage insurance for $1,000 per year.  
(transference).  
 3. We could brick in the windows for a one-time cost of $10,000. (avoidance).  
 4. We could put metal screens over the windows for a one-time cost of  
$3,000 (Reduce/Mitigate).  
 5. Arrest the kids and make an example of them. (elimination)
