

From an attacker’s perspective, **SMTP relays** play a crucial role in executing phishing attacks. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) relays are used to send emails from one server to another before reaching the final recipient. In the context of phishing, attackers use SMTP relays to obscure their true identity and increase the success rate of their attacks.

Here’s a detailed explanation of how SMTP relays are used in phishing attacks:

### 1. **Understanding SMTP Relays**

SMTP relays act as intermediaries in the process of sending emails. When an email is sent, it often passes through several SMTP servers or relays before reaching its destination. This relaying process helps in handling and routing emails across different networks.

### 2. **Phishing Attacks and SMTP Relays**

In phishing attacks, attackers use SMTP relays to achieve several objectives:

#### a. **Anonymity and Obfuscation**

- **Masking Source:** Attackers use SMTP relays to hide their true origin. By routing emails through various relays, they make it more difficult to trace the email back to their original server or location. This helps them avoid detection and increases the likelihood of the email bypassing security filters.
- **Avoiding Blacklists:** Directly sending phishing emails from a known malicious server can quickly lead to blacklisting. By using compromised or legitimate SMTP relays, attackers avoid immediate blacklisting of their own infrastructure.

#### b. **Improving Deliverability**

- **Bypassing Filters:** Many email security systems use reputation-based filtering to detect and block phishing emails. SMTP relays with good reputations (e.g., those used by legitimate services) can help phishing emails evade these filters and reach the intended recipients.
- **Avoiding Spam Traps:** Phishing emails sent directly from suspicious or newly registered domains might trigger spam traps or other security mechanisms. Using well-established SMTP relays helps in avoiding such traps.

#### c. **Scaling Attacks**

- **Mass Emailing:** SMTP relays can handle large volumes of email traffic. Attackers can use these relays to send thousands or even millions of phishing emails quickly and efficiently, increasing the reach of their attack.
- **Distributed Attacks:** Attackers can utilize multiple SMTP relays to distribute their phishing emails, making it harder for security systems to identify and block the entire attack.

### 3. **Common Methods for Abusing SMTP Relays**

#### a. **Compromised SMTP Servers**

- Attackers may gain unauthorized access to SMTP servers (often through weak credentials or vulnerabilities) and use them as relays to send phishing emails. These servers may belong to legitimate businesses or organizations that are unaware they are being used maliciously.

#### b. **Open Relays**

- An open relay is an SMTP server that allows anyone to send emails through it, without proper authentication. Attackers exploit open relays to send phishing emails anonymously. Although open relays are less common today due to better security practices, they are still used in some attacks.

#### c. **Botnets**

- Attackers may use botnets—networks of compromised computers—to send phishing emails via various SMTP relays. This distributed approach makes detection and mitigation more challenging for security teams.

### 4. **Countermeasures**

To protect against phishing attacks that leverage SMTP relays, organizations can implement several measures:

- **Email Filtering and Analysis:** Use advanced email security solutions that analyze incoming emails for signs of phishing, even if they come from relays with good reputations.
- **Domain and IP Reputation Monitoring:** Monitor and block known malicious domains and IP addresses that are associated with phishing attacks.
- **SMTP Server Security:** Ensure that your SMTP servers are properly secured and configured to prevent unauthorized use. Disable open relay settings and use strong authentication mechanisms.
- **User Education:** Train users to recognize and report suspicious emails, reducing the likelihood of successful phishing attempts.


## Relay Examples 



### **SendGrid**

**SendGrid** is a cloud-based service that provides email delivery and marketing solutions. It’s commonly used for sending transactional emails (e.g., order confirmations, password resets) and marketing emails (e.g., newsletters, promotions).

#### **Potential Phishing Exploits**

1. **Trusted Infrastructure:**
    
    - **Advantages for Attackers:** SendGrid is a reputable service with a strong infrastructure. Phishing emails sent from SendGrid’s servers may be perceived as more trustworthy due to the platform's established reputation and robust delivery systems. Attackers might use SendGrid to bypass spam filters that are less stringent on emails from reputable services.
    - **Example:** An attacker could create a fraudulent email campaign using SendGrid’s infrastructure to deliver phishing emails that appear to come from a legitimate source, such as a well-known company.
2. **Legitimate Sending Domains:**
    
    - **Advantages for Attackers:** Attackers might use SendGrid to send emails from domains that appear legitimate or are closely mimicking trusted domains. This can make the phishing attempt more convincing, as the email may carry a legitimate-looking domain name and branding.
    - **Example:** An attacker could use SendGrid to send phishing emails from a domain that closely resembles a real domain, using SendGrid’s tools to make the emails look authentic.
3. **Customization and Tracking:**
    
    - **Advantages for Attackers:** SendGrid offers advanced features like email customization, tracking, and analytics. Attackers can exploit these features to create highly personalized phishing emails and track their success (e.g., open rates, click-through rates).
    - **Example:** An attacker could use SendGrid’s tracking tools to determine which recipients are engaging with their phishing emails and refine their tactics based on this data.



### **MailChimp**

**MailChimp** is another leading email marketing platform that allows users to create, send, and analyze email campaigns. It is widely used for newsletters, promotional campaigns, and customer engagement.

#### **Potential Phishing Exploits**

1. **Reputation and Deliverability:**
    
    - **Advantages for Attackers:** Like SendGrid, MailChimp has a solid reputation and high deliverability rates. Phishing emails sent via MailChimp may benefit from the service’s infrastructure, making it harder for recipient email systems to classify them as spam or malicious.
    - **Example:** An attacker could use MailChimp’s services to send phishing emails that benefit from the platform’s high deliverability, potentially evading spam filters.
2. **Design and Branding:**
    
    - **Advantages for Attackers:** MailChimp provides users with extensive design capabilities, allowing for the creation of visually appealing and well-branded emails. Attackers can exploit these capabilities to design phishing emails that closely resemble legitimate communications from reputable brands.
    - **Example:** An attacker could use MailChimp’s design tools to craft a phishing email that mimics a high-quality promotional email from a known brand, increasing the likelihood that recipients will fall for the scam.
3. **API and Integration:**
    
    - **Advantages for Attackers:** MailChimp offers APIs and integrations that allow for sophisticated email campaigns. Attackers could use these features to automate phishing campaigns or integrate phishing efforts with other malicious activities.
    - **Example:** An attacker could use MailChimp’s API to automate the sending of phishing emails to a large number of recipients, potentially in conjunction with other attack vectors.

### **Defensive Measures**

To mitigate the risk of phishing attacks involving services like SendGrid and MailChimp, consider the following measures:

- **Email Filtering:** Implement advanced email filtering and security solutions that can detect and block phishing attempts, even if they come from reputable email service providers.
- **Authentication and Verification:** Use domain authentication methods such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to help verify the authenticity of emails and protect against domain spoofing.
- **User Training:** Educate users about phishing threats and the signs of phishing emails, including how to verify the legitimacy of communications.
- **Monitoring and Reporting:** Regularly monitor email activity for suspicious behavior and report any phishing attempts to the relevant service providers.
