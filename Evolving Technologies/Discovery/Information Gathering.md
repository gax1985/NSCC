## Passive Recon

>[!question]
>
>What is **Passive Reconnaissance**?
>
>>[!answer]
>>
>>**Passive reconnaissance** involves gathering information about a target without directly interacting with the target system. This means that the attacker does not leave any trace or alert the target of their activities. The goal is to collect as much information as possible without being detected.
>>

**Examples of Passive Reconnaissance:**

1. **WHOIS Lookup:** Checking domain registration details to find information about the domain owner, contact information, and server details.

## Active Recon


>[!question]
>
>What is **Active Reconnaissance**?
>
>>[!answer]
>>
>>**Active reconnaissance** **Active reconnaissance** involves directly interacting with the target system to gather information. This type of recon is more intrusive and can be detected by the target. The goal is to probe the target system to identify vulnerabilities and gather detailed information.
>>


**Examples of Active Reconnaissance:**

1. **Port Scanning:** Using tools like ``Nmap`` to scan the target system’s open ports and services.
   
   >[!example]
   >
   >``
   >nmap -sV  # Version Scan (to identify the versions of running services)
   >``
   >or 
   >
   >``
   >nmap --script=smb*
   >``
   
   
   
2. **Network Mapping:** Identifying the network topology, devices, and their configurations using tools like ``traceroute`` or network discovery tools.
3. **Vulnerability Scanning:** Running automated tools like ``Nessus`` or ``OpenVAS`` to identify known vulnerabilities in the target system.
4. **Banner Grabbing:** Sending requests to services running on open ports to gather information about the software and versions in use.
