DNSRecon is a Python script that provides the ability to perform:

- Check all NS Records for Zone Transfers.
- Enumerate General DNS Records for a given Domain (MX, SOA, NS, A, AAAA, SPF and TXT).
- Perform common SRV Record Enumeration.
- Top Level Domain (TLD) Expansion.
- Check for Wildcard Resolution.
- Brute Force subdomain and host A and AAAA records given a domain and a wordlist.
- Perform a PTR Record lookup for a given IP Range or CIDR.
- Check a DNS Server Cached records for A, AAAA and CNAME
- Records provided a list of host records in a text file to check.
- Enumerate Hosts and Subdomains using Google

>### DNSRecon Features Explained

1. **Check all NS Records for Zone Transfers**:
    
    - **NS Records**: Name Server records that specify the authoritative DNS servers for a domain.
    - **Zone Transfers**: The process of copying DNS records from one DNS server to another. This feature checks if any of the NS records allow zone transfers, which can reveal all DNS records for the domain.
2. **Enumerate General DNS Records for a given Domain (MX, SOA, NS, A, AAAA, SPF, and TXT)**:
    
    - **MX**: Mail Exchange records, which specify mail servers for the domain.
    - **SOA**: Start of Authority records, which provide information about the DNS zone and its primary DNS server.
    - **NS**: Name Server records, as mentioned above.
    - **A**: Address records, which map domain names to IPv4 addresses.
    - **AAAA**: Address records, which map domain names to IPv6 addresses.
    - **SPF**: Sender Policy Framework records, which help prevent email spoofing.
    - **TXT**: Text records, which can contain arbitrary text data, often used for SPF, DKIM, etc.
3. **Perform common SRV Record Enumeration**:
    
    - **SRV Records**: Service records used to define the location of servers for specified services.
4. **Top Level Domain (TLD) Expansion**:
    
    - **TLD**: The last part of a domain name, such as `.com`, `.org`, `.net`. This feature expands the search to include all possible TLDs for a given domain name.
5. **Check for Wildcard Resolution**:
    
    - **Wildcard Resolution**: A DNS configuration where a wildcard DNS record (e.g., `*.example.com`) resolves to a specific IP address. This feature checks if wildcard DNS records are in use.
6. **Brute Force subdomain and host A and AAAA records given a domain and a wordlist**:
    
    - **Brute Force**: A method of systematically trying all possible combinations to find valid subdomains and hostnames.
    - **Wordlist**: A list of potential subdomains and hostnames used for brute-forcing.
7. **Perform a PTR Record lookup for a given IP Range or CIDR**:
    
    - **PTR Records**: Pointer records used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping IP addresses back to domain names.
    - **IP Range or CIDR**: Specifies the range of IP addresses to perform the reverse lookup on.
8. **Check a DNS Server Cached records for A, AAAA, and CNAME**:
    
    - **Cached Records**: DNS records stored temporarily by a DNS server to speed up subsequent queries.
    - **CNAME**: Canonical Name records, which alias one domain name to another.
9. **Records provided a list of host records in a text file to check**:
    
    - This feature allows you to provide a list of hostnames in a text file, and DNSRecon will check the DNS records for each hostname.
10. **Enumerate Hosts and Subdomains using Google**:
    
    - This feature uses Google search queries (Google Dorks) to find indexed subdomains and hosts related to the target domain.
