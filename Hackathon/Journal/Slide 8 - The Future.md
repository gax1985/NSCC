>>I would like to get feedback from michael and polish the project into something that he could legitimately use to help him. 


###### How would you tackle the confidentiality, integrity and availability considerations for the data in question?

>>It would be nice to have error checking and have the program be more stable, as for security, if it remains a locally run program that wouldn’t really be an issue as the only way to use our program is to have access to all the students grades. 

###### How would you use Artificial Intelligence to improve this project (trend analysis, compiling a list of students who are facing challenges in their academic journey)?

>>I’m not entirely sure if AI lends itself to the analysis of student data, I feel like it raises security concerns if the data is not properly anonymized. That being said one thing I think AI could excel at it the pdf extraction portion I mentioned earlier, as student maps are not private information it would be cool to have that part done in a way that account for changing formats and structures.
