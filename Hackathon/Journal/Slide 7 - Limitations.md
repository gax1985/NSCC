>>I found a lot of the data to be difficult to work with and require some creative thinking to work with. Things weren’t named the same across the spreadsheet and pdf so it required some fun solutions. A little example I can share is that the spreadsheet of the student’s data has a cell for the student’s program but only in the form of an acronym (ITDBADMIN -> IT Database Administration). The way I mapped all the equivalences of these acronyms to the proper programs was to generate a little frequency table of each class taken by a student grouped by the acronym, and then to reference that to the program info I had already parsed and determine which program had the most overlap!
