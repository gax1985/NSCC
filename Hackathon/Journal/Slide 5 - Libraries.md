>>Most importantly for my end: 
>>
>>	Opencv: for image manipulation of the pdfs 
>>	Pandas: dataframes for quick and efficient data analysis 
>>	Matplotlib: Generating the filled academic roadmap 
>>	Etc: there are many more smaller libraries I used for helper functions, like loading pdfs, wrapping text for the map but those are the main ones I used.
