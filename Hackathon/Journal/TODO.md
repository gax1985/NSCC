### Summary

**Program Structure and Advising Process:**

- - [ ] **Program Duration:** 2-year cohort-based program with 6 courses per semester.
    
- - [ ] **Manual Advising:** Advising is manual, manageable for 10 students but tedious for 100.
    
- - [ ] **Transcript Handling:** Transcripts are manually reviewed and discussed with students.
    
- - [ ] **Advising Outcome:** A plan is created at the end of the meeting, listing current and next semester courses.
    

**Data Management:**

 - [ ]  **Data Requirements:** Student ID, name, courses taken, grades, and program details.
    
- [ ]  **Data Source:** Data is manually extracted from PeopleSoft and stored in spreadsheets.
    
- [ ]  **Academic Plan:** Academic plans are created and updated manually, including handling failed courses.
    

**Advising Workflow:**

- [ ]  **Initial Setup:** Determine the academic plan for the student.
    
- [ ]  **Data Entry:** Populate required courses and off-sequence sheets.
    
- [ ] **Student Information:** Search by ID to retrieve student details and grades.
    
- [ ]  **Plan Creation:** Create a plan that includes completed, current, and new semester courses.
    
- [ ]  **Manual Updates:** Manually update the plan and input data as needed.
    

**Challenges and Solutions:**

- [ ]  **Manual Process:** The current manual process is time-consuming and inefficient for large numbers of students.
    
- [ ]  **Failed Courses:** Handling failed courses requires manual adjustments to the academic plan.
    
- [ ]  **Data Consistency:** Ensuring data consistency and accuracy across different semesters and plans.
    

**Desired Features:**

- [ ] **Automated Advising System:** A system that automates data retrieval, plan creation, and updates.
    
- [ ] **Kanban Board:** A visual tool to manage and track student progress and course requirements.
    
- [ ] **Dashboard:** An automated view of the academic pathway, highlighting dependencies and alternate options.
    

**Questions and Considerations:**

- **Transcript Format:** What format should transcripts be in? (PeopleSoft)
    
- **Data Import:** How to import and manage data from PeopleSoft and other sources.
    
- **User Interface:** What format and features are needed for the advising interface?
    
- **Course Dependencies:** How to visually indicate course dependencies and alternate pathways.
    

### Next Steps

- [ ] **Develop Automated System:** Create a system to automate data retrieval, plan creation, and updates.
    
- [ ] **Implement Kanban Board:** Use a Kanban board to manage and track student progress.
    
- [ ] **Design User Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface for advisors to view and update student plans.
