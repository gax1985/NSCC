>>- An academic map that will let michael know at a glance where a student is at.
###### How did you reach your choice pertaining to the manner of presenting the output to the user?

>
>>We wanted to keep things simple for a minimal viable product. We didnt want to include too many bells and whistles, just a quick and easy way of getting information that could be useful without bogging michael down with having to interface with a complicated app

###### What sort of options were you considering to improve Michael's duties at work?

>[!Brad]

>>My main goal was to automate the process of manually populating documents, while retaining the form of the end-result, as to mitigate potential issues in usability and ensuring the final document's format was similarto the previous one. Michael may be the client, but ultimately the registrar needs to view this information. Consistency between designs allows for streamlined onboarding.

>>The main things are letting him see the gist of a students academic roadmap as well as increase the efficiency of filling out the academic forms for the registrar
