He began in the military in the army side of things, and it took him on a different path. It is a small community. Have the conversation with community members. It is about having meaningful conversations with people. You could have a potential disagreement with someone, but since it is a small community, you may run into them later. We help each other out in the community. Start general and narrow it down. 

### 5. Start in a general capacity

>>Focus on the **knowledge**, not the *certification itself*!


If he is building a solution for a client, such as a project he is doing now where he is charged in monitoring skill sets, he places a far greater importance on *how they do things and solve problems* rather than the *skills*. 

With projects, the general idea for the project may change in the span of six months!

The ability to work in groups is tremendously important! If you have one skill you are brilliant at, such as building a firewall, you may need an individual who is brilliant at programming. Working in groups and surviving the work is greatly important as well. 

Another Speaker : When they are hiring new individuals, they may be looking for a specific set of skills. 

>[!warning]

>>Make sure you have **multiple skillsets**!

>>>How can I improve myself with *hard skills*, such as **programming a firewall** etc ...

The other speaker (who said the question above) : You may be tasked with programming this hypothetical firewall. You may be placed in a situation where you have to explain the purpose of the firewall, and how it works. You may also have to justify the costs of this firewall based on the complete understanding of how it works. 

Example of said situation :

It is a measure of soft skills and hard skills. Working with internal and external stakeholders is great for establishing security requirements. It is kind of qualitative.


Question : He is looking at Indeed and LinkedIn, and noticed it was difficult to find a position for a beginner in the field. Could you provide us with recommendations? 
Answer :

>>If you meet individuals in the Cybersecurity industry, invite them for a coffee or reach out to have a conversation. Their institution may not be hiring, but they may know another institution that *is hiring* ...

>>He was in the miltary, and met someone who is the Head of Physical Security. They spoke, there was a position he did not obtain, but when he found a permanenet position, he called him for guidance.

>>[!warning]

>>It is a difficult job market right now. 


Another speaker : We are looking at a lack of a silver bullet in terms of personality and organizational culture, and you end up with social networks that tend to form. On one side, we have t he social groups that started forming on LinkedIn. It is a bit of a mixed bag. We also have different associations. A lot of people he ran into happened to be through **internships**. When he was in the military, he wanted to do a lot of interesting things. He recommended going into the Reserves, which is facing a shortage. 


Question : Having significant experience in the industry, what faults do you notice on new recruits? 

Answer : Arrogance. Humility goes a long way! You should not use the words "Not my job!", but instead, use "It may not be my duties, but *how can I help?*". A great empasis is placed on **constructive feedback**. He mentioned that we should not *dismiss our past experiences and past contacts*. Once you figure out your fallacies, figure out your *solutions*! Be confident in what you know and what you are capable of. Different backgrounds bring different strengths. Do not take yourself in a dismissive way. Constructive feedback is how we grow. If you may have a thought "I can not do this due to these factors ...". When you are working on a project, you may have to stand up in front of a CEO and say "Our solution did not work, but *here is what we have learned from the experience* ...". At the end of the day, **functioning within a group** is critical to the success of the **team** and the **organization**. Get comfortable within your own skills, and **do not be afraid to fail**. We live in a society where the idea of **failure is the ultimate catastrophe**... *Get comfortable with failing and mistakes*. Look at *what happened*, and *how did it happen*? Could you identify the source, isolate it and contain it?  Organizations are all about first impressions.  Stick with the facts behind the challenges , as it is a logical way to grow. 

Another answer : "You **are** going to make mistakes. If you do it once, learn from it.". Someone he knows said "the only time you are the smartest person in the room is in the *bathroom*.


Ron : 


Your reputation in this industry began the day we started in the program. The community is small, and your reputation will follow! Part of the skills you can bring to your employment is the ability of knowing how to deal with others. If your employer decides on a person to assign a task to, you should be the top likely choice. When you are trying to solve a problem, it is about the **need to solve the puzzle**. It is simple to say to be a *good person*, *effective communicator*", and sometimes, being *honest* is not always being pleasant! Ron would notice for example that someone lacks a particular skill. That is not an issue! If someone is *arrogant*, that is far worse. Ron was in a Union meeting, the head of the union mentioned he has been there for 20 years or so, and he could not solve the problem!". Ron mentioned that he was told to change behavior, and you do not change it, and you repeat the exact same behavior again, that means you have made **no effort to change**... If someone makes a mistake, there would be an ever-increasing inner voice that says "How can I solve this problem?" and "what can I learn from this problem?". 

Ron's questions to speakers : 

1. In situations that are frightening, challenging or funny, can you share such a situation ?
   

   1. Were there any point in your career were you felt *ethically-challenged*?

>[!first speaker]

	>During his time at the **Bank of Canada** as a contractor , he spoke to someone who took the client to lunch. He was coming back home from the office, someone punches him and smashes his nose. He was being treated for 30 minutes. He walks out of the hospital, and hears a sound of Pepper Spray. He was attacked 5 minutes later. He went back to the office and reported the incident to the Manager. There was not ant followup from management. He mentioned to the management that  they have personal safety issues, which means *organized crime*. In terms of money laundering, there was an investigations, and they were tracking serial numbers of Canadian Dollar Bills. When you are the Domain Lead , you face ethical challenges all the time. Parts for ship construction are expensive. He faced situations when he spoke up on a couple of occasions to question the ethics of particular incidents. The safety of the workers is paramount. Make sure you handle those situations carefully, and document *everything*! 

>[!Another speaker]

>He volunteered for the Canadian Communication Standards. He realized that it is not about the ethical questions of situations, but being aware of your conduct, and you may face an ethical board to question your actions. You may lose the rights to continue your path. There has been an incident where an inappropriate personal relationship took place.

> in 2013, there were discussions of modernization. The first thing concerning the local infrastructure is to talk to the *local bosses*. Get an idea about what is going on. Do not talk to regional directors. If you go to Risk Management, you have to be careful. If you are in charge of improving Physical Security at the land border, visit every single point of interest to check on it. You can use this analogy in ordinary situations as well, as it is a lesson of *diligence*! If he opted to sit back in an office and say everything is fine due to the lack of data that says otherwise, this would not work, as a proactive action is needed to truly investigate the challenge at hand. At the end of the day, *get used to picking your allies*! Ethical challenges will happen *at least* on a daily basis! You may have a lot of challenges on your path.
