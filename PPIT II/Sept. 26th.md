# Saying the Right Things to the Right People

## Introduction

We will explore how you should communicate with different types of people at work:

### Customers

Non Technical People
Technical training
Project Managers
Executives

### Future Presentations
When delivering assignment presentations and your project report you will deliver your presentation to specific audiences.

### A peer presentation 
Be able to deliver a typical presentation with an introduction, body and conclusion

### A training session
Train the class in the concept.  Use teach, practice, confirm.

### An executive briefing  
Take the subject and explain it to an executive.  Answer the question: What's it worth? How's it going? (comment on the state of "it" currently).

4 Building Blocks of Communication

## Part 1: Communicating with Customers
Your role: supporting the provision of a good or service typically in a retail atmosphere.

Personalize the interaction.
Avoid negative phrases.
Use positive language with a touch of empathy.
Listen closely and avoid interrupting the customer.
Use consistent vocabulary.
Give thorough answers to technical questions- speaking at their level of technical knowledge.
Make communication clear and concise.

## Part 2:  Communicating Technical Concepts to Non Technical People
Using Analogy
What is Analogy

An analogy is something that shows how two things are alike, but with the ultimate goal of explaining something through this comparison.

#### Two types:
To identify identical relationships.
Black is to white as on is to off.
To identify shared abstraction. 

Raising children is like gardening-- nutrture them and be patient.

##### Examples
Coding concepts explained in analogy

Favourite analogies to explain IT concepts

Analogy to introduce databases

Data storytelling: The power of analogy

## Part 3: Technical Training
When you are teaching technical topics you are not simply giving a presentation.  It is not good enough to give a lecture composed of an introduction, body and conclusion.

In order to properly teach someone how to use technology you need to:

Technical Training Process
Consider the context 
Consider the audience and their needs
Think about the type of information you are teaching (fact/concept, procedure, process or principle)
Break the information into small manageable chunks (aka Teaching points)
Think about how best to explain the information. Perhaps through analogy?
Teach it
Allow for practice
Confirm the student's learning through some kind of check/test before moving on to the next teaching point (stages 5-6-7-8)
Provide final concluding remarks and feedback
Types of Technical Content
Facts/Concepts:  This is supporting information to understand something specific (the small picture)
How to teach it:  You need to provide definitions and practice with mnemonics and games.
Classroom practice: review different examples to see if it fits the concept criteria.
Procedures: This task related information to understand something specific (the small picture)
How to teach it: Provide a clear statement & demonstration of the steps. 
Classroom practice: students should do hands-on activities with explanatory feedback.
Processes: This is supporting information to understand the big picture
How to teach it: provide all concepts first, then explain the stages using a flow diagram.
Classroom practice: Use realistic case studies with post exercise debriefs.
Principles: This is task related information to understand the big picture
How to teach it: goal is to build a mental model that can be adapted to changing situations. Provide a statement of principles with guidelines.
Classroom practice: provide a series of case studies

## Part 4: Communicating with a project manager
The elements of a project are:

Scope: refers to what you are doing and not doing
Budget: refers to how much money you have to spend
Time: refers to when work needs to be done
Quality: refers to state of the work (ie. are you making a prototype or a ready for market product?) 
Think of these as dials on a car reporting fuel and speed.  They tell you things like full and empty or high and low. 

You would communicate in this way:

Status Update: First you need to report the status.   It is either on track, ahead of schedule or behind schedule.  The default expectation is that things should be on track and on schedule.
Why the change:  Succinctly explain why things have changed. Do not go into a lot of detail. Be able to explain in a few brief sentences.  Only give more detail if they ask you to give it.
Recommendation:  Give your recommended next steps, based on the current status of a project.
DO NOT give too much detail.  Only do so when asked specific questions. 


## Part 5: Communicating with executives
Providing an Initiative Update

Answer two things:

What is it worth?
How's it going?
Being precise and accurate is important.   

Your job is not to make something look good. Help them assess what is going on.

Balance passion with credibility

Providing an Initiative Update
Answer what it's worth and how it's going.

How to explain How's it going:

You are not doing a code review where you explain step by step.
Instead you are giving a big picture explanation of where you are in the process.
Pitching an Idea
Pitch an idea to an executive

Answer these questions:

Should I invest my time?
Do I think you have the credibility to get it done?
Don't start with the solution. (Don't start with what you want to do). Instead get agreement on the problem.   

"The people who understand the problems the most earn the right to solve them." Daniel Shapero, COO LinkedIn

Build a balance between problem and solution.  Energy gets built when you understand a problem in its largest sense. But credibility gets built by making sure that the person understands enough about the details that you (the executive) thinks that they can get it done.  

Be able to describe the situation at two levels of detail.
