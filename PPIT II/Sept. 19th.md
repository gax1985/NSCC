## 1. What do you value?


Your values are the things that you believe are important in the way you live and work. They (should) determine your priorities, and, deep down, they're probably the measures you use to tell if your life is turning out the way you want it to.   For a list of values go here:  [https://www.mindtools.com/a5eygum/what-are-your-values](https://www.mindtools.com/a5eygum/what-are-your-values)

# What Are Your Values?

## Deciding What's Important in Life


>[!info]
**Key Takeaways**
>
>- Your personal values are a central part of who you are – and who you want to be.
>- By becoming more aware of these vital factors in your life, you can use them as a guide to make the best choice in any situation.
>- Some of life's decisions are really about determining what you value most. When many options seem reasonable, you can rely on your values to point you in the right direction.

**How would you define your values?**

Before you answer this question, you need to know what, in general, values are.


>[!definition]
>Your values are the things that you believe are important in the way you live and work.

**They (should) determine your priorities**, and, deep down, they're probably the measures you use to tell if your life is turning out the way you want it to.

When the things that you do and the way you behave match your values, life is usually good – you're satisfied and content. *But when these don't align with your personal values, that's when things feel wrong*. This can be a real source of unhappiness.


This is why making a conscious effort to identify your values is so important.

So, in this article and in the video, below, we're going to take a look at how you can identify your personal values.

 

 

## How Values Help You

Values exist, whether you recognize them or not. Life can be much easier when you acknowledge your values – and when you make plans and decisions that honor them.

If you value family, but you have to work 70-hour weeks in your job, will you feel internal stress and conflict? And if you don't value competition, and you work in a highly competitive sales environment, are you likely to be satisfied with your job?

 

In these types of situations, understanding your values can really help. When you know your own values, you can use them to make decisions about how to live your life, and you can answer questions like these:

>[!question]
>
>These following questions would be answered by analyzing your **Personal Values** : 
>- What job should I pursue?
>- Should I accept this promotion?
>- Should I start my own business?
>- Should I compromise, or be firm with my position?
>- Should I follow tradition, or travel down a new path?


So, take the time to understand the real priorities in your life, and you'll be able to determine the best direction for you and [your life goals](https://www.mindtools.com/a5ykiuq/personal-goal-setting)!

#### Tip:

Values are usually fairly stable, yet they don't have strict limits or boundaries. Also, as you move through life, your values may change.

For example, when you start your career, success – measured by money and status – might be a top priority.

But after you have a family, work-life balance may be what you value more.

As your definition of success changes, so do your personal values. This is why keeping in touch with your values is a lifelong exercise. You should continuously revisit this, especially if you start to feel unbalanced... and you can't quite figure out why.

As you go through the exercise below, bear in mind that values that were important in the past may not be relevant now.


>[!video]
>
>- Your values are what you consider to be most important, in work and in life. When your behavior aligns with your values, you'll likely feel content and satisfied. But, when they don't, things can feel, well, wrong, and this can be a source of deep unhappiness. Knowing and understanding your values helps you to make decisions about how you live your life, so you can live it with integrity, knowing that the choices you made are the right ones for you. But, how can you figure out what values are most meaningful to you? Start by taking a look back on your life. Think about the times when you were most happy. What were you doing? What was it that made you so happy? Then think about your proudest moments. Did others share your pride? What else contributed to this feeling? Next, reflect on times that you felt fulfilled and satisfied. Consider what need or desire of yours was being met at the time. How and why did this give your life meaning? Now, determine your most important values based on the moments you've just reflected on. Why was each experience memorable? What principles did they represent? Note down 10 or so values, and look for any similarities. For instance, if you identify both honesty and openness, you could combine these into one core value of authenticity. Once you've identified your most important values, prioritize the ones that best define you. This can be tricky to do, so take your time. It can be helpful to compare two values on your list, and visualize a situation where you'd have to choose between them. If you had to choose just one, which would it be? Finally, look at the key values you've picked out. Do they feel right, and make you feel good about yourself? Would you feel proud and comfortable to share them with someone that you admire? Do you stand by them, even if they're unpopular choices? Living by your values will help you to lead a more honest and meaningful life, and to make decisions you believe in. But, be aware that your values may change over time, even if right now you can't imagine them doing so. It can be a good idea to repeat this exercise every few years or so, or after big life events, to reaffirm what's most important to you. © Mind Tools Ltd

## Defining Your Values

 

When you define your personal values, you discover what's truly important to you. 

>[!tip]
>
>A good way of starting to do this is to look back on your life – to identify when you felt really good, and really confident that you were making good choices.


### Step 1: Identify the times when you were happiest

Find examples from both your career and personal life. This will ensure some balance in your answers.

 
>[!question]
>
>When you are *happy* ...
>
>- What were you doing?
>- Were you with other people? Who?
>- What other factors contributed to your happiness?

>[!answers]
>
>1. Doing Archaeology, bringing food to the shelters, studying Cybersecurity at NSCC and when I am in Creative Mode (working on the goals I have set for myself to accomplish)!
>2. I was with my colleagues in Archaeology, my friends, colleagues in NSCC and when I am alone!
>3. Being in love with Cybersecurity and technology, having a goal of helping others, and being around individuals who shared the same outlook!


 
### Step 2: Identify the times when you were most proud

Use examples from your career and personal life.

>[!question]
>
>When you are *proud* ...
>- Why were you proud?
>- Did other people share your pride? Who?
>- What other factors contributed to your feelings of pride?


### Step 3: Identify the times when you were most fulfilled and satisfied

 

Again, use both work and personal examples.

- What need or desire was fulfilled?
- How and why did the experience give your life meaning?
- What other factors contributed to your feelings of fulfillment?

>[!answer]
>
>1. The desire to learn, the desire to help, and being in my element (Earth)!
>2. I was able to be, albeit temorarily, in nature, understand what drives me to help others and remembering that the path I am on takes toil.
>3. Watching the outcomes of my initiatives!

### Step 4: Determine your top values, based on your experiences of happiness, pride, and fulfillment

Why is each experience truly important and memorable? Use the following list of common personal values to help you get started – and aim for about 10 top values. (As you work through, you may find that some of these naturally combine. For instance, if you value philanthropy, community and generosity, you might say that service to others is one of your top values.)

### Step 5: Prioritize your top values

This step is probably the most difficult, because you'll have to look deep inside yourself. It's also the most important step, because, when making a decision, you'll have to choose between solutions that may satisfy different values. This is when you must know which value is more important to you.

 

- Write down your top values, not in any particular order.
- Look at the first two values and ask yourself, "If I could satisfy only one of these, which would I choose?" It might help to visualize a situation in which you would have to make that choice. For example, if you compare the values of service and stability, imagine that you must decide whether to sell your house and move to another country to do valuable foreign aid work, or keep your house and volunteer to do charity work closer to home.
- Keep working through the list, by comparing each value with each other value, until your list is in the correct order.

 

#### Tip:

If you have a tough time doing this, consider using [Paired Comparison Analysis](https://www.mindtools.com/auvbv1a) to help you. With this method, you decide which of two options is most important, and then assign a score to show how much more important it is. Since it's so important to identify and prioritize your values, investing your time in this step is definitely worth it.

### Step 6: Reaffirm your values

Check your top-priority values, and make sure that they fit with your life and your vision for yourself.

 

- Do these values make you feel good about yourself?
- Are you proud of your top three values?
- Would you be comfortable and proud to tell your values to people you respect and admire?

 

- Do these values represent things you would support, even if your choice isn't popular, and it puts you in the minority?

When you consider your values in decision making, you can be sure to keep your sense of integrity and what you know is right, and approach decisions with confidence and clarity. You'll also know that what you're doing is best for your current and future happiness and satisfaction.

Making value-based choices may not always be easy. However, making a choice that you know is right is a lot less difficult in the long run.

 

## Top Tip for Defining Your Own Core Values

You can breathe life into your values by defining briefly, in writing, what they represent to you. Crystalizing what they stand for and why they matter to you will help embed their importance.

Keep the definitions short and write them in your own words, so you are really connected to them. These definitions will be handy reminders of who you are and what matters most to you – when and if you need reminding when there are decisions to be made.

 

For example, if one of your core values is “creativity” you might say, “I value it because the ability to solve problems and to come up with fresh, new ideas brings me joy and a deep sense of fulfillment.”

Your personality type is:

## Protagonist

# ENFJ-A

![A scene depicting the Protagonist personality type (ENFJ). An adult ENFJ, wearing a green soccer jersey, stands on a soccer field with three young players, all in matching uniforms.

The image conveys the ENFJ’s natural inclination towards leadership, especially in guiding and developing others.](https://www.16personalities.com/static/images/types/headers/protagonist-mobile.svg)

As an ENFJ (Protagonist), you possess a unique blend of charisma, empathy, and idealism that sets you apart in any crowd. Your natural ability to inspire and lead others is matched only by your deep-seated desire to make a positive impact on the world around you. You have an uncanny knack for understanding people’s emotions and motivations, often sensing what others need before they even realize it themselves.

Your gift for communication allows you to articulate your visionary ideas with passion and conviction, drawing others into your orbit and motivating them to join your cause. You thrive on meaningful connections and have a remarkable talent for bringing out the best in those around you. However, your idealistic nature can sometimes set you up for disappointment when reality falls short of your lofty expectations.

Your empathetic nature is both your greatest strength and your potential Achilles’ heel. While it allows you to form deep, authentic connections with others, it can also leave you vulnerable to emotional exhaustion. You may find yourself taking on others’ problems as your own, sometimes at the expense of your own well-being.

As a natural-born leader, you have an innate ability to rally people around a common goal. Your enthusiasm is infectious, and you excel at creating harmonious, productive environments. However, you may struggle with criticism or conflict, as your desire for harmony can sometimes lead you to avoid necessary confrontations. Learning to balance your idealism with pragmatism and your care for others with self-care will be key to your personal and professional fulfillment.

## 2Your Career Path

![](https://www.16personalities.com/static/images/type-report/enfj-career.svg)

Your career path is likely to be driven by a deep-seated need to make a meaningful difference in people’s lives. You thrive in roles that allow you to inspire, guide, and develop others, making you an excellent teacher, counselor, or team leader. Your natural charisma and ability to articulate a compelling vision make you a standout in fields like human resources, public relations, or non-profit management.

While you excel in collaborative environments and roles that involve personal interaction, you may find yourself less fulfilled by solitary or highly analytical work. Your challenge lies in balancing your idealistic drive with practical realities, and in learning to value the smaller, day-to-day contributions as much as the grand, world-changing gestures. Your ability to positively influence even one person’s life is a significant achievement in itself.

## 3Your Personal Growth

![](https://www.16personalities.com/static/images/type-report/enfj-personal-growth.svg)

Your journey of personal growth is fueled by an insatiable desire for self-improvement and a genuine commitment to becoming the best version of yourself. You set high standards for your own behavior and are often your own harshest critic. While this drive can lead to remarkable personal development, it’s crucial to temper it with self-compassion and realistic expectations.

A key area of growth for you involves learning to set healthy boundaries and prioritize self-care. Your natural inclination to put others’ needs before your own can lead to burnout if left unchecked. Developing practical skills to complement your idealistic nature, and learning to appreciate the value of solitude and introspection, will contribute significantly to your personal evolution and overall well-being.
