## Ethics in Cyber Security

Ethical Scenarios for Organisations

## Guidance for Use

**The scenarios below are intended as a reference repository for individual cyber security practitioners and member organisations to aid ethical judgement and behaviour.**

They have been sourced from experiences faced by various professional bodies in recent years, and the processes described are based on the results of these investigations. The Council may update these scenarios, or add new ones, from time to time.

For each scenario, the applicable ethical Principle - contained either within the Code of Ethics for Member Organisations or within the Guiding Ethical Principles for Cyber Security Practitioners - is shown. For scenarios that a practitioner may face, issues have been identified as either professional or personal.

The scenarios included are examples and do not represent an exclusive list. Both Member Organisations and practitioners are encouraged to recommend further scenarios to the Council for inclusion and to provide support to the cyber security community. The Council’s Ethics Committee will review both existing and suggested scenarios, building on them as necessary to ensure that all ethical Principles are represented, and determining whether the corresponding issues are appropriate for the Committee itself to address.
