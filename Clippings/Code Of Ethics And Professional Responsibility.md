A Code of Ethics is essential to protect the integrity of the certification process. The ISFCE places a high value on maintaining a sound and enforced Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility (Code). Upholding the integrity of the CCE certification is in the best interest of all ISFCEMembers. The ISFCE will thoroughly and impartially investigate all suspected violations of the Code by CCE candidates and certified members.
- All CCE candidates and certified members must agree to and abide by the ISFCE Code to obtain and maintain the CCE certification. Violations of the Code may result in the suspension or revocation of CCE certification.
- If the Code is revised, all CCEs will be required to agree to and abide by the current Code upon recertification to maintain their certification.
- The ISFCE, along with all CCE candidates and certified members, is responsible for upholding the highest ethical standards in the CCE certification. This includes demonstrating integrity, impartiality, diligence, and professionalism at all times.
- CCE candidates and certified members who become aware of suspected violations of the Code must report such violations to the ISFCE as soon as reasonably possible.
- All work required to complete the CCE certification process must be performed solely by the individual CCE candidate. Collaboration, joint work, cheating, or plagiarism in completing the CCE process is strictly prohibited.
- CCE candidates and certified members may not share or discuss specific certification examination problems or materials with anyone that may assist in completing the CCE process, either during or after the certification process.
- CCE candidates may not use the CCE designation or imply that they are CCE certified until they are officially awarded the CCE certification by the ISFCE. It would be a violation of this Code for an applicant to publicly indicate that they have passed a particular section of the CCE.
