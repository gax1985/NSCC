#### **1. Who is the “Head of the Public Body”?**

**Applicable Act**: **Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPOP)**, Chapter 5 of the Acts of 1993.

**Reference**: **FOIPOP, c. 5, s. 3(1)(c)(iii)**

**Quotation from the Act**:

**Answer**:

In the case of the IWK Hospital:

- The IWK Health Centre operates as a hospital with its own Board of Directors and does **not** report directly to a minister in its day-to-day operations.
  
- Therefore, according to **FOIPOP, c. 5, s. 3(1)(c)(iii)**, the "Head of the Public Body" is the **Chair of the Board of Directors** of the IWK Hospital.
