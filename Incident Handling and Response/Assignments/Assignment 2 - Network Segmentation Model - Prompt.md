I have a project where we would make a Packet Tracer module that would be implemented physically in class. We have two lab computers for our group, and our own switch (CISCO Catalyst 3560) and Router (CISCO 4321). May I ask you for your humble guidance on providing me with the correct approach to tackle this noble task? I need to get the module working first in Packet Tracer, and after that is done, implement it physically!.

PC1
192.168.9.10

PC2 
192.168.9.20

SWITCH 9
FA0/2
FA0/3
FA0/4

SWITCH 10 
FA0/2
FA0/3
FA0/4

Router 
GIGABITETHERNET0/0/0


We need to create VLAN 9 , and connect our switch with the other group's switch.



We have to be able to ping all machines on all subnets
