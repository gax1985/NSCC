>>It is the unauthorized access to data


Hypothetically, an organization produced a report that is confidential, and it would be terribly damaging to have unauthorized individuals access this report. If an employee or a CEO is not entitled to see the report, this is considered to be a *Data Breach*.

These pieces of legislation that we will examine will contain a series of proscribed steps in them. 

If the event ever comes to light, if you are the individual who enabled it to happen, the responsibility would be on *you*. Your boss is not allowed to ask you to violate the law. It would be better to have a **Change Management Policy**, where every change has to be approved by a committee for example. 

There was an interesting ruling in Nova Scotia in the 1990s, where a company in Nova Scotia committed fraud, and confessed to it via a chain of emails. The company was out of business. When selling their computers, someone bought the whole lot, and discovered the emails on the computers. The ruling said that the email system was part of the company, and the emails themselves are a property of the participants of the email. 

If a company recorded a phone call, who claims ownership of the recording? 


It is much better to establish change management so you can have a documented chain of events. 

In terms of the legislation we are reviewing, even if we have it documented in writing, we would be bound to be asked by an organization to commit an action that is morally questionable. Ron mentioned that back in the 1990s, when Ron was focused on establishing security-based startups, every six weeks Ron had to make a financial assessment through a report to be presented by the CEO, who in turn would present it to the board. In the period of a financial collapse, which happened gradually, Ron's predictions of the fund was dismal. He took the report to the CEO, and the CEO was asked about his opinion. The CEO mentioned that they need a new analyst. Ron was asked to produce a phony report that mentions that everything is fine financially. Ron had to ponder the decision, and decided to produce a glowing report. He knew this was not an idle threat, and Ron's financial situation was not capable of withstanding the CEO's threat. As far as Ron was concerned, he did not think it was breaking any laws, and could not be charged legally, even through it is immoral. In our careers, we are likely to get into situations that would challenge our moral standing and view. 


In the intelligence world, these activities are done all the time with the understanding that the evidence will not be used in a trial. The situation would not be brought to trial. The individuals will not be likely prosecuted. We will also have to consider ethical questions.


There is a concept in law called Maine's Raise (latin?), or guilty concience. 


The nature of this work is to be faced by moral challenges. It is tempting to get addicted to your capabilities. A high degree of personal discipline is required to govern yourself. 

Ron in his career was in a situation when he was speaking to a financial officer, and he mentioned that junior security analysts could have a lot of access to confidential information, and the officer responded that any action they would commit would cause them their peril. 

Ron would like us to develop a practice and skill in reviewing a piece of legislation to determine what we should and should not do. 


### Incident Response Steps 


Legislation is **Domain-Specific**.

>[!question]

>What is **Domain-Specific** ?
>
>	Any privately owned company is governed by a specific piece of federal legislation called **PIPEDA**. Historically, PIPEDA was weak on breaches. There was no requirement of having to declare or inform the public about a breach. Under law, you did not need to tell anyone. Canada was a bit behind the G7 consortium. There was a historial incident in the US which addressed this issue. It was tied to the fact that government regulators wanted companies to encrypt their data due to massive theft and exploitation taking place on a daily basis. Ron was in another city in Canada interviewed by a journalist, and the journalist asked the law enforcement member about the number of cyber intrusions took place in the city, and the officer responded that he did not know of any breaches. Companies did not usually call the police on a breach, due to a company's success model being based on customers trusting the organization, and that would shatter that view. This was in the late 1990s-early 2000s. There was a growing number of incidents at that time where a whistleblower informed the public about these incidents, and companies got sued due to this. The idea was that when a breach happens, we should develop a list of actions to take to ensure the public's trust and minimize the damage to it. There were a number of pieces that brought with them the need to *disclose*, on the pain of facing lawsuits. In the US, there was an individual who held the approach that you can not stop the thefts and intrusions, when the time period was the early days of botnets, and every bank was being hacked. Some smart individuals said that it was necessary for every organization who possesses personal information on individuals , such as Social Security Numbers, and the organization has to encrypt the data. Thus, there was a need for such a legislation. It was a difficult task due to questions such as what sort of encryption was necessary, and other encryption-related steps. Ron was guiding individuals on the steps to encrypt the data, even through the encryption would not withstand a well organized attack. There was an event with a company in India that had a chemical spill into the drinking water, which caused the deaths of many. If they have informed the public on the spill, that would have saved lives. Thus, India put through a legislation that it would severly punish any entity that would refuse to declare the incident much worse that the punishment for the spill itself. Thus, the senator had the idea of mandating that the organizations is legally liable to inform the public on the breach within a time period. The punishment for not reporting the incident was extreme, with one exception where the data is encrypted with a specific encryption standard, which would negate the necessity of declaring the incident. The result was everyone encrypted the data, as no one wanted to report incidents. Between 2015-2020 in Canada, there was a push to require entities to report breaches. If the data is encrypted, no one cares. If you are working for a private company in Canada, and you wanted to know your legal requirements, you would examine PIPEDA. Ron's wife has a PHD in Privacy. She was active in the groups developing these policies. Privacy experts would regularly meet, and they knew that every jurisdiction and domain would have different privacy laws. They could not write legislations that were too specific, so instead, they came up with the **Fair Information Practices**, which are 10 recommendations for actions to take to protect the data. If you could demonstrate you practice these principles, the liklihood of legal reprecussions diminish greatly.

## Public Sector


It is divided into :

#### Provincial Legislations

The provincial legislations are very specific. In our assignment , we discuss a breach at the IWK. There are other provincial bodies and agencies where they can be contacted to inquire about the steps to take. 

One example : Provincial Health Information Act
#### Federal Legislations

If you work for a federal agency, you would have the **Privacy Act**, which is easily confusing due to the large number of divisions in the government, such as the Treasury. If you work for that institution, you would have to abide by both *Federal* and *Institutional* regulations. If you work for the federal government, you would have :

 FOIPOP : Freedom of Information Protection of Privacy Act


#### Intersecting Regulations

There are intersecting points between provincial and federal legislations. Consider provinces that like their independence. There is a domain for Publically Traded Companies. The legislation that governs this in the US is called The **Sarbenes Oxley(SOX) Act**. The Canadian version is very similar. 


#### Industry-Specific Regulations 

Each of the following would have their own regulations that you have to abide by , and could lead to being sued for not doing your due care :

Medicine
Law 
Finance
Accounting 


You might have an incident that demands certain requirements due to legislations that you have to abide by. You would have to look up the act that you have to abide by, and you would need to read a maximum of 2-3 acts. 


Ron had to review write and train companies on how to write contracts. Ron is very familiar with Contract Law. Ron had no idea how to read the contract, and it turns out there is a lot of commonalities, such as certain terms being used, sections about governing laws ( that would have their reprecussions). In legislations, there are standard sections. In our field, there are some standard terms we will look for (typically found). In the assignment, we have a breach, so we have to decide on Nova Scotia Health Information Act, which is 50 pages. You would look for key words such as : 


1. Unauthorized
2. Breach
3. Penalties
4. Reporting
5. Fine

This will drive you to certain sections of the document, but you would not start by reading the whole thing. Then, there are terms that are common : 

1. Head of the Public Body 
   
	   This person has a specific role to play. You can find who is the head of the public body. Sometimes, it is not one person but a group of individuals, a minister in a particular department, etc. 
	   

>[!definition]
>
>**Custodian** :
>
>>The person who is responsible for protecting data and making decisions 

You would start with what you think is the **most fitting legislation**, and go from there. You would arrive at the right conclusions fairly quickly.


In a lot of cases, the recommended actions and decisions to make, have a *deadline*. When you get into some legislation, it gets very vague. 


The best legislation is something that says : 


"notifications must be granted in 2 days"


Cover Your Ass Legislation --> as soon as reasonably possible!


In several pieces of legislation, there is a section on the potential for embarrassment. There are some of us that are easily embarrassed, and there is a wide spectrum of something that would cause us embarrassment. If you lost the records of 10000 individuals, you would rely on Cover Your Ass Legislation. Certain actions may not have to take place. These are specific cases you would find in the legislation. 


With the development of the Cloud, and the possibility of creating a Data Center with a credit card, this will reduce IT costs. During Ron's professional practice, in the public sector, you would not be legally able to store data outside of Canada. Amazon had to place data centers in Canada to abide by this requirement. Some entities in Nova Scotia had issues, where some departments headed by an individual would decide to store data outside of Canada. Provinces started to write provincial legislation governing public sector data storage outside of Canada. The legislation, as far as the public knew, was in place to protect the public. If you write a legislation that says " You are not allowed to do this *except ...*", the foundation of the legislation is to protect the entities in question. 

These sort of things cover the legal frameworks of what you are required to do in the event of a breach. Ron had many conversations with lawyers that had no idea about specific legislations that cover data loss. Their legal origins may not involve the same field, and even if this area is not your specialty, and if someone does not know what to do , you could point them in the right direction, and you would use this knowledge to protect yourself and the client. If a boss did not respond about a requirement due to legislation, then you would prepare to leave this sinking ship. 


>[!Next Class ...]

>Ron will test pilot a synopsis of some **Considerations you may have about ethical elements when facing an incident/situation ...** It is to help you understand your *moral* framework that stems from *legal* framework. It is important to think of this in advance. If a storm is raging all around you, it would not be the right time to reflect on the situation. Thus , knowledge is key! 

Last week, we discussed that the best way to avoid panic is to **have a plan**! The plan needs to be executed, *sans emotion* , and just follow the plan. It is not exactly the same thing, when it comes to morality, if you have decided in advance what kind of person you are, you are likely to respond to a crisis *calmly* ...

We are expected to work with the understanding of the morality and legal aspects, as well as following our *well-formed plan*!
