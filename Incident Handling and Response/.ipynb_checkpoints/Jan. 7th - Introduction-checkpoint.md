Insider malicious actors are increasing in numbers. It is very tempting for insiders to install a malicious tool on an organization's system, and then collect a huge portion of the ransomware attack's proceeds. There are many incidents that are a direct result of that. Ron was investigating an organization, and when the entity that hired them announced that Ron is on the case, this employee fled the country immediately. Prior to that, every single incident of ransomware in Ron's career was a result of an employee clicking on an email. 


Ron's approach to protect against ransomware is to lock the door, aka protect the endpoints that the malicious actor would install the malicious tool on. 

Ron wishes that he has recorded the source 2018, which took place in SECOM 2018. A British researcher gave a talk about a study she did where the employees would be told not to click on the link in phishing email, and employees that have not been trained. Her results said that it showed no statistical difference between the employees that were trained vs the employees that were not trained. We have to make sure everyone is protected by drastically decreasing their access. Everyone is usually fine with the limitations in protection except the leadership team (CEO) due to them discovering that they can not get a file, and then get angry. It is about good practices. If someone said "Give complete access to the team", run away as fast as possible due to it heading into disaster.
