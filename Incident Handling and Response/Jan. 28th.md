# Network Segmentation 


Two Steps : 


#### Model 

Work from September. It is important to add all the factual identities of those who are working in the isles with you. 



#### Physical Implementation 


Ron will assign VLAN numbers to each group of 2 individuals. You have to know the VLAN number with the people you work with. We use the third octet of the network address being the VLAN number. 

>[!example]
>
>If your **VLAN** number is **1** : 
>
>>`192.168.1.1`


We are doing this in the private network realm, but we will be doing an exposed node with **bridging**, and it will have access to the internet. 


>[!warning]
>
>Start Network Segmentation this time next week. We have to : 

1. Do the model
2. Prove it works
3. Implement the model you made in **Packet Tracer**. 


Keeping that in mind ...

> Assignment is the minor portion of the Packet Tracer assignment. Micro-Segmentation is **key** towards preparedness to Physical Response!

If you are the Network Administrator, you take the plan and implement it. 

In our case, we made the plan, and make it a reality! 


Make sure the design is perfect. If there are errors, it causes points to be lost!

>[!critical]

>Implement a **Change Management** of the design!

If, for some reason, you have to make a change to the design (VLAN names , etc) you have to get the change **approved**! We will *not* make this up on the fly!


Take a look at your schedule for the assignment due dates. We need to decide on a **due date**!


>[!todo]
>
>Do a TODO list. Your milestones should be fairly distributed across the next few weeks!

Tomorrow morning, we do not have **Attack Vectors class**! Ron is doing a briefing!


TODO List : 

Sock Puppets **Feb. 7th**
Cyber Breach **Jan. 31st**
Capstone        **Feb. 4th**
Penetration Testing **Jan.30th**
